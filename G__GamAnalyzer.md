# An introduction to GamAnalyzer

It aims at the development of a new java agent model, the "agent_group_follower" usable from Gama. This new agent is to monitor and analyze agent groups of a simulation in which the user wants to study the behavior and evolution. These groups of target agents of "agent_group_follower" are defined according to criteria chosen by the user. The monitoring process and analysis of these agents involves the extraction, processing and visualization of their data at every step of the simulation. To highlight and to effectively operate the observable dynamics and emerging phenomena such target agents, this process must be compatible with the multiple simulations performance, as well as successive parallel. The data for each simulation must then be pooled and treated commonly for their graphic representation or clusters.
