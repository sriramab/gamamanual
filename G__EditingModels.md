# Introduction

Editing models in GAMA is very similar to editing programs in a modern IDE like [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.rog). After having successfully [launched](G__Launching.md) the program, the user has two fundamental concepts at its disposal: a **workspace**, which contains models or links to models organized like a hierarchy of files in a filesystem, and the **workbench** (aka, the _main window_), which contains the tools to create, modify and experiment these models.

Understanding how to navigate in the **workspace** is covered in [another section](G__NavigatingWorkspace.md) and, for the purpose of this section, we just need to understand that it is organized in **projects**, which contain **models** and their associated data. **Projects** are further categorized, in GAMA, into three categories : _Models Library_ (built-in models shipped with GAMA and automatically linked from the workspace), _Shared Models_, and _User Models_.

This section covers the following sub-sections :

  * 1. [GAML Editor](G__GamlEditor.md)
  * 2. [Validation of Models](G__ValidationOfModels.md)
  * 3. [Graphical Editor](G__GraphicalEditor.md)
