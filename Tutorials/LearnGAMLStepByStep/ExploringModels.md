# Exploring Models

We just learnt how to launch GUI Experiments from GAMA. A GUI Experiment will start with a particular set of input, compute several outputs, and will stop at the end (if asked).
In order to explore models (by automatically running the Experiment using several configurations to analyze the outputs), you can run an other type of experiment : the Batch Experiment.
We will first see in this part how [batch experiments](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Content\Tutorials\LearnGAMLStepByStep\ExploringModels\BatchExperiments.md) work, then we will focus on how to use those batch experiments to explore models by using [exploration methods](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Content\Tutorials\LearnGAMLStepByStep\ExploringModels\ExplorationMethods.md).
