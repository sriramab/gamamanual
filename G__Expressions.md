# Expressions

---

Expressions in GAML are the value part of the [statements](Statements161)' facets. They represent or compute data that will be used as the value of the facet when the statement will be executed.

An expression can be either a [literal](G__Literals), a [unit](G__UnitsAndConstants), a [constant](G__UnitsAndConstants), a [variable](ExpressionVariables161), an [attribute](G__VariablesAndAttributes) or the application of one or several [operators](G__OperatorsAK) to compose a complex expression.
