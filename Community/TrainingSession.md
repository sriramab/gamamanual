This training session took place at the Apsara Authorities, where we introduced how to build a model with agent-based approach, using GAMA. In a new and very fast growing city such as Siem Reap, some measures have to be taken to anticipate the future of the city, and modeling is a science that can give some solutions to face those problems.

The training session was divided into 2 parts :
* A theoretical part (3 days) dealing with the following subjects :
  * Urban issues and introduction to Agent-Based Modeling
  * Presentation of the modeling methodology
  * Introduction to GAMA with a model on urban segregation
  * GIS datas and graphs to model urban mobility
  * GIS, Raster datas and graphs to model urban growth
  * Use of experiments to calibrate and explore models
* A practical part (2 days) to build a model about urban mobility in Siem Reap (by groups of 4/5 people)
