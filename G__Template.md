# Template



This page serves as a template to demonstrate the conventions used in writing the documentation of GAMA. Please try to respect them ! The ‘summary’ pragma must be clear and precise about the contents of the page. The ‘sidebar’ pragma must refer to the new G\_TOC table of contents. The first header should have the same text as the one used in GTOC. The own table of contents of the page should follow this ‘introduction’.





## 2nd Level Headers (title)
These headers should be preceded by a break and a line, and the first letter of each word should be capitalized.

### 3rd level headers
No specific rules apply for the 3rd/4th level headers.





## 2nd Level Headers (text)
Try to always introduce some text after a header, in order to avoid the immediate repetition of headers, which can be confusing as they are not indented.
### 3rd Level header
With also some introductory text.
#### 4th level header
Which should contain something otherwise just delete it (empty headers are not really useful)
