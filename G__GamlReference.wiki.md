# Gaml Reference

---

The following pages introduce the various constructs that are made available to the modelers in GAML. All these constructs are **built-in**, i.e. defined in Java, either in the core of GAMA or in its extensions. They include [species](G__BuiltInSpecies.md), [skills](G__BuiltInSkills.md), [control architectures](G__BuiltInControlArchitectures.md), [statements](G__Statements.md), [data types](G__DataTypes.md), and various types of [expressions](G__Expressions.md), including a long and quite exhaustive list of [operators](G__OperatorsAK.md).

This set of pages is to be used as a _reference_, which means its role is not to explain _how_ to properly use these constructs but to detail their structures and components.

It is, in that respect, to be used as a support for following the explanations provided in the sections dedicated to the [organization of a model](G__OrganizationModel.md), [the definition of species](G__DefiningSpecies.md), the definition of [GUI](G__DefiningExperiments.md) or [batch](G__BatchExperiments.md) experiments, and the various recipes or  how-to's provided [here](G__Recipes.md). It also serves as a precious guide for the various constructs introduced in the [tutorials](G__Tutorials.md).
