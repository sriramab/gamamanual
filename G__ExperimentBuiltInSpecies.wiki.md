# The 'experiment' built-in species (Under Construction)

---

As described in the [presentation of GAML](G__KeyConcepts.md), any experiment attached to a model is a species (introduced by the keyword [`experiment`](G__ExperimentSpecies.md)) which directly or indirectly inherits from an abstract species called `experiment` itself. This abstract species (sub-species of [`agent`](G__AgentBuiltInSpecies.md)) defines several attributes and actions that can then be used in any experiment.

## `experiment` attributes
`experiment` defines several attributes, which, in addition to the attributes inherited from [`agent`](G__AgentBuiltInSpecies.md), form the minimal set of knowledge any experiment will have access to.
