\hypertarget{java-version}{%
\chapter{Java version}\label{java-version}}

Due to changes in the libraries used by GAMA 1.7 and 1.8, this version now \textbf{requires JDK/JVM 1.8} to run. Please note that GAMA \textbf{has not been tested with JDK 1.9 and 1.10}.

\section{Changes between 1.6.1 and 1.7/1.8 that can influence the dynamics of models}\label{changes-between-1.6.1-and-1.71.8-that-can-influence-the-dynamics-of-models}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Initialization order between the initialization of variables and the execution of the \texttt{init} block in grids
  init -\textgreater{} vars in 1.6.1 / vars -\textgreater{} init in 1.7
\item
  Initialization order of agents -\textgreater{} now, the init block of the agents are not executed at the end of the global init, but during it.
  put a sample model to explain the order of creation and its differences
\item
  Initialization of vars to their default value
  map ? list ?
\item
  Systematic casting and verification of types
  give examples
\item
  header of CSV files: be careful, in GAMA 1.7, if the first line is detected as a header, it is not read when the file is casted as a matrix (so the first row of the matrix is not the header, but the first line of data)
  gives examples
\item
  the step of batch experiments is now executed after all repetitions of simulations are done (not after each one). They can however be still accessed using the attributes \texttt{simulations} (see Batch.gaml in Models Library)
\item
  signal and diffuse have been merged into a single statement
\item
  facets do not accept a space between their identifier and the \texttt{:} anymore.
\item
  simplification of equation/solve statements and deprecation of old facets
\item
  in FIPA skill, \texttt{content}is replaced everywhere with \texttt{contents}
\item
  in FIPA skill, \texttt{receivers} is replaced everywhere with \texttt{to}
\item
  in FIPA skill, \texttt{messages} is replaced by \texttt{mailbox}
\item
  The pseudo-attribute \texttt{user\_location} has been removed (not deprecated, unfortunately) and replaced by the ``unit'' \texttt{\#user\_location}.
\item
  The actions called by an \texttt{event} layer do not need anymore to define \texttt{point} and \texttt{list\textless{}agent\textgreater{}} arguments to receive the mouse location and the list of agents selected. Instead, they can now use \texttt{\#user\_location} and they have to compute the selected agents by themselves (using an arbitrary function).
\item
  The random number generators now better handle seeding (larger range), but it can change the series of values previously obtained from a given seed in 1.6.1
\item
  all models now have a starting\_date and a current\_date. They then dont begin at an hypothetical ``zero'' date, but at the epoch date defined by ISO 8601 (1970/1/1). It should not change models that dont rely on dates, except that:
\item
  the \#year (and its nicknames \#y, \#years) and \#month (and its nickname \#month) do not longer have a default value (of resp. 30 days and 360 days). Instead, they are always evaluated against the current\_date of the model. If no starting\_date is defined, the values of \#month and \#year will then depend on the sequence of months and year since epoch day.
\item
  \texttt{as\_time}, \texttt{as\_system\_time}, \texttt{as\_date} and \texttt{as\_system\_date} have been removed
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{simulations}{%
\section{Simulations}\label{simulations}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  simulations can now be run in parallel withing an experiment (with their outputs, displays, etc.)
\item
  batch experiments inherit from this possibility and can now run their repetitions in parallel too.
\item
  concurrency between agents is now possible and can be controlled on a species/grid/ask basis (from multi-threaded concurrency to complete parallelism within a species/grid or between the targets of an \texttt{ask} statement)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{language}{%
\section{Language}\label{language}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{gama} : a new immutable agent that can be invoked to change preferences or access to platform-only properties (like \texttt{machine-time})
\item
  \texttt{abort}: a new behavior (like \texttt{reflex} or \texttt{init}) that is executed once when the agent is about to die
\item
  \texttt{try} and \texttt{catch} statements now provide a robust way to catch errors happening in the simulations.
\item
  \texttt{super} (instead of \texttt{self}) and \texttt{invoke} (instead of \texttt{do}) can now be used to call an action defined in a parent species.
\item
  \texttt{date} : new data type that offers the possibility to use a real calendar, to define a \texttt{starting\_date} and to query a \texttt{current\_date} from a simulation, to parse dates from date files or to output them in custom formats. Dates can be added, subtracted, compared. Various new operators (\texttt{minus\_months}, etc.) allow for a fine manipulation of their data. Time units (\texttt{\#sec}, \texttt{\#s}, \texttt{\#mn}, \texttt{\#minute}, \texttt{\#h}, \texttt{\#hour}, \texttt{\#day}, etc.) can be used in conjunction with them. Interval of dates (date1 to date2) can be created and used as a basis for loops, etc. Various simple operators allow for defining conditions based on the current\_date (after(date1), before(date2), since(date1), etc.).
\item
  \texttt{font} type allows to define fonts more precisely in \texttt{draw} statements
\item
  BDI control architecture for agents
\item
  file management, new operators, new statements, new skills(?), new built-in variables, files can now download their contents from the web by using standard http: https: addresses instead of file paths.
\item
  The \texttt{save} can now directly manipulate files and \ldots{} save them. So something like \texttt{save\ shape\_file("bb.shp",\ my\_agents\ collect\ each.shape);} is possible. In addition, a new facet \texttt{attributes} allows to define complex attributes to be saved.
\item
  \texttt{assert} has a simpler syntax and can be used in any behaviour to raise an error if a condition is not met.
\item
  \texttt{test} is a new type of experiments (\texttt{experiment\ aaa\ type:\ test\ ...}), equivalent to a \texttt{batch} with an exhaustive search method, which automatically displays the status of tests found in the model.
\item
  new operators (\texttt{sum\_of}, \texttt{product\_of}, etc.)
\item
  casting of files works
\item
  co-modeling (importation of micro-models that can be managed within a macro-model)
\item
  populations of agents can now be easily exported to CSV files using the \texttt{save} statement
\item
  Simple \texttt{messaging} skill between agents\\
\item
  Terminal commands can now be issued from within GAMA using the \texttt{console} operator
\item
  New \texttt{status} statement allows to change the text of the status.
\item
  light statement in 3D display provides the possibility to custom your lights (point lights, direction lights, spot lights)
\item
  Displays can now inherit from other displays (facets \texttt{parent} and \texttt{virtual} to describe abstract displays)
\item
  \texttt{on\_change:} facet for attributes/parameters allows to define a sequence of statements to run whenever the value changes.
\item
  \texttt{species} and \texttt{experiment} now support the \texttt{virtual} boolean facet (virtual species can not be instantiated, and virtual experiments do not show up).
\item
  \texttt{experiment} now supports the \texttt{auto\_run} boolean facet (to run automatically when launched)
\item
  \texttt{experiment} now supports the \texttt{benchmark} boolean facet (to produce a CSV summary of the time spent in the different statements / operators of GAMA)
\item
  experiments can now have their own file (\texttt{xxx.experiment}) and specify the model they are targeting by providing the path to the model in the new \texttt{model:} facet (similar to \texttt{import}).
\item
  experiments can sport a new type: \texttt{test}, a specialised type of batch experiment that can be run automatically from the GUI or in headless and reports back the result of the tests found in its model
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{learn-gaml-beginner--i}{%
\chapter{Learn GAML (Beginner -I)}\label{learn-gaml-beginner--i}}

If you are a beginner, the next 4 chapters will introduce you to the GAML language. To learn the language, follow this recommended sequence:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Literals
\item
  Types or Data Types
\item
  File Types
\item
  Pseudo-variables
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{literals}{%
\chapter{Literals}\label{literals}}

\emph{(some literal expressions are also described in \href{DataTypes}{data types})}

A literal is a way to specify an unnamed constant value corresponding to a given data type. GAML supports various types of literals for often --- or less often --- used data types.

\hypertarget{table-of-contents}{%
\section{Table of contents}\label{table-of-contents}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{literals}{Literals}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{simple-types}{Simple Types}
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{literal-constructors}{Literal Constructors}
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{universal-literal}{Universal Literal}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{simple-types}{%
\section{Simple Types}\label{simple-types}}

Values of simple (i.e.~not composed) types can all be expressed using literal expressions. Namely:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{bool}: \texttt{true} and \texttt{false}.
\item
  \textbf{int}: decimal value, such as \texttt{100}, or hexadecimal value if preceded by \texttt{\textquotesingle{}\#\textquotesingle{}} (e.g. \texttt{\#AAAAAA}, which returns the int \texttt{11184810})
\item
  \textbf{float}: the value in plain digits, using \texttt{\textquotesingle{}.\textquotesingle{}} for the decimal point (e.g. \texttt{123.297})
\item
  \textbf{string}: a sequence of characters enclosed between quotes (\texttt{\textquotesingle{}my\ string\textquotesingle{}}) or double quotes (\texttt{"my\ string"})
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{literal-constructors}{%
\section{Literal Constructors}\label{literal-constructors}}

Although they are not strictly literals in the sense given above, some special constructs (called \emph{literal constructors}) allow the modeler to declare constants of other data types. They are actually \href{Operators}{operators} but can be thought of literals when used with constant operands.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{pair}: the key and the value separated by \texttt{::} (e.g. \texttt{12::\textquotesingle{}abc\textquotesingle{}})
\item
  \textbf{list}: the elements, separated by commas, enclosed inside square brackets (e.g. \texttt{{[}12,15,15{]}})
\item
  \textbf{map}: a list of pairs (e.g. \texttt{{[}12::\textquotesingle{}abc\textquotesingle{},\ 13::\textquotesingle{}def\textquotesingle{}{]}})
\item
  \textbf{point}: 2 or 3 int or float ordinates enclosed inside curly brackets (e.g. \texttt{\{10.0,10.0,10.0\}})
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{universal-literal}{%
\section{Universal Literal}\label{universal-literal}}

Finally, a special literal, of type \texttt{unknown}, is shared between the data types and all the agent types (aka species). Only \texttt{bool}, \texttt{int} and \texttt{float}, which do not derive from \texttt{unknown}, do not accept this literal. All the others will accept it (e.g. \texttt{string\ s\ \textless{}-\ nil;} is ok).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{unknown}: \texttt{nil}, which represents the non-initialized (or, literally, \emph{unknown}) value.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{types}{%
\chapter{Types}\label{types}}

A variable's or expression's \emph{type} (or \emph{data type}) determines the values it can take, plus the operations that can be performed on or with it. GAML is a statically-typed language, which means that the type of an expression is always known at compile time, and is even enforced with casting operations.
There are 4 categories of types:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

\hypertarget{bool}{%
\subsection{bool}\label{bool}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} primitive datatype providing two values: \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} both \texttt{true} or \texttt{false} are interpreted as boolean constants.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} expressions that require a boolean operand often directly apply a casting to bool to their operand. It is a convenient way to directly obtain a bool value.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
bool (0) -> false
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{float}{%
\subsection{float}\label{float}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} primitive datatype holding floating point values, its absolute value is comprised between 4.9E-324 and 1.8E308.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} this datatype is internally backed up by the Java double datatype.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} decimal notation 123.45 or exponential notation 123e45 are supported.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} expressions that require an integer operand often directly apply a casting to float to their operand. Using it is a way to obtain a float constant.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
float (12) -> 12.0
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{int}{%
\subsection{int}\label{int}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} primitive datatype holding integer values comprised between -2147483648 and 2147483647 (i.e.~between \texttt{-2\^{}31} and \texttt{2\^{}31\ -\ 1}.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} this datatype is internally backed up by the Java int datatype.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} decimal notation like 1, 256790 or hexadecimal notation like \#1209FF are automatically interpreted.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} expressions that require an integer operand often directly apply a casting to int to their operand. Using it is a way to obtain an integer constant.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
int (234.5) -> 234.
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{string}{%
\subsection{string}\label{string}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype holding a sequence of characters.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} this datatype is internally backed up by the Java String class. However, contrary to Java, strings are considered as a primitive type, which means they do not contain character objects. This can be seen when casting a string to a list using the list operator: the result is a list of one-character strings, not a list of characters.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, like `this is a string' . If one wants to literally declare strings that contain quotes, one has to double these quotes in the declaration. Strings accept escape characters like \texttt{\textbackslash{}n} (newline), \texttt{\textbackslash{}r} (carriage return), \texttt{\textbackslash{}t} (tabulation), as well as any Unicode character (\texttt{\textbackslash{}uXXXX}).
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} see string
\item
  \textbf{Example:} see \href{Operators\#strings-related-operators}{string operators}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{complex-built-in-types}{%
\section{Complex built-in types}\label{complex-built-in-types}}

Contrarily to primitive built-in types, complex types have often various attributes. They can be accessed in the same way as attributes of agents:

\begin{verbatim}
complex_type nom_var <- init_var;
ltype_attr attr_var <- nom_var.attr_name;
\end{verbatim}

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
file fileText <- file("../data/cell.Data");
bool fileTextReadable <- fileText.readable;
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{agent}{%
\subsection{agent}\label{agent}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a generic datatype that represents an agent whatever its actual species.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} This datatype is barely used, since species can be directly used as datatypes themselves.
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} the agent casting operator can be applied to an int (to get the agent with this unique index), a string (to get the agent with this name).
\end{itemize}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{container}{%
\subsection{container}\label{container}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a generic datatype that represents a collection of data.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} a container variable can be a list, a matrix, a map\ldots{} Conversely each list, matrix and map is a kind of container. In consequence every container can be used in container-related operators.
\item
  \textbf{See also:} \href{Operators\#containers-related-operators}{Container operators}
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
container c  <- [1,2,3];
container c  <- matrix [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]];
container c  <- map ["x"::5, "y"::12];
container c  <- list species1;
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{file}{%
\subsection{file}\label{file}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype that represents a file.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    name (type = string): the name of the represented file (with its extension)
  \item
    extension(type = string): the extension of the file
  \item
    path (type = string): the absolute path of the file
  \item
    readable (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the file is readable
  \item
    writable (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the file is writable
  \item
    exists (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the file exists
  \item
    is\_folder (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the file is folder
  \item
    contents (type = container): a container storing the content of the file
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} a variable with the \texttt{file} type can handle any kind of file (text, image or shape files\ldots{}). The type of the \texttt{content} attribute will depend on the kind of file. Note that the allowed kinds of file are the followings:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    text files: files with the extensions .txt, .data, .csv, .text, .tsv, .asc. The \texttt{content} is by default a list of string.
  \item
    image files: files with the extensions .pgm, .tif, .tiff, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .pict, .bmp. The \texttt{content} is by default a matrix of int.
  \item
    shapefiles: files with the extension .shp. The \texttt{content} is by default a list of geometry.
  \item
    properties files: files with the extension .properties. The \texttt{content} is by default a map of string::string.
  \item
    folders. The \texttt{content} is by default a list of string.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} Files are also a particular kind of container and can thus be read, written or iterated using the container operators and commands.
\item
  \textbf{See also:} \href{Operators\#files-related-operators}{File operators}
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} a file can be created using the generic \texttt{file} (that opens a file in read only mode and tries to determine its contents), \texttt{folder} or the \texttt{new\_folder} (to open an existing folder or create a new one) unary operators. But things can be specialized with the combination of the \texttt{read}/\texttt{write} and \texttt{image}/\texttt{text}/\texttt{shapefile}/\texttt{properties} unary operators.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
folder(a_string)  // returns a file managing a existing folder
file(a_string) // returns any kind of file in read-only mode
read(text(a_string)) // returns a text file in read-only mode
read(image(a_string)) // does the same with an image file.
write(properties(a_string)) // returns a property file which is available for writing 
                            // (if it exists, contents will be appended unless it is cleared 
                            // using the standard container operations).
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{geometry}{%
\subsection{geometry}\label{geometry}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype that represents a vector geometry, i.e.~a list of georeferenced points.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    location (type = point): the centroid of the geometry
  \item
    area (type = float): the area of the geometry
  \item
    perimeter (type = float): the perimeter of the geometry
  \item
    holes (type = list of geometry): the list of the hole inside the given geometry
  \item
    contour (type = geometry): the exterior ring of the given geometry and of his holes
  \item
    envelope (type = geometry): the geometry bounding box
  \item
    width (type = float): the width of the bounding box
  \item
    height (type = float): the height of the bounding box
  \item
    points (type = list of point): the set of the points composing the geometry
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} a geometry can be either a point, a polyline or a polygon. Operators working on geometries handle transparently these three kinds of geometry. The envelope (a.k.a. the bounding box) of the geometry depends on the kind of geometry:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If this Geometry is the empty geometry, it is an empty point.
  \item
    If the Geometry is a point, it is a non-empty point.
  \item
    Otherwise, it is a Polygon whose points are (minx, miny), (maxx, miny), (maxx, maxy), (minx, maxy), (minx, miny).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{See also:} \href{Operators\#spatial-operators}{Spatial operators}
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} geometries can be built from a point, a list of points or by using specific operators (circle, square, triangle\ldots{}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
geometry varGeom <- circle(5);
geometry polygonGeom <- polygon([{3,5}, {5,6},{1,4}]);
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{graph}{%
\subsection{graph}\label{graph}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype that represents a graph composed of vertices linked by edges.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    edges(type = list of agent/geometry): the list of all edges
  \item
    vertices(type = list of agent/geometry): the list of all vertices
  \item
    circuit (type = path): an approximate minimal traveling salesman tour (hamiltonian cycle)
  \item
    spanning\_tree (type = list of agent/geometry): minimum spanning tree of the graph, i.e.~a sub-graph such as every vertex lies in the tree, and as much edges lies in it but no cycles (or loops) are formed.
  \item
    connected(type = bool): test whether the graph is connected
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Remark:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    graphs are also a particular kind of container and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.
  \item
    This algorithm used to compute the circuit requires that the graph be complete and the triangle inequality exists (if x,y,z are vertices then d(x,y)+d(y,z)\textless{}d(x,z) for all x,y,z) then this algorithm will guarantee a hamiltonian cycle such that the total weight of the cycle is less than or equal to double the total weight of the optimal hamiltonian cycle.
  \item
    The computation of the spanning tree uses an implementation of the Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. If the given graph is connected it computes the minimum spanning tree, otherwise it computes the minimum spanning forest.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{See also:} \href{Operators\#graph-related-operators}{Graph operators}
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} graphs can be built from a list of vertices (agents or geometries) or from a list of edges (agents or geometries) by using specific operators. They are often used to deal with a road network and are built from a shapefile.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
create road from: shape_file_road;
graph the_graph <- as_edge_graph(road);

graph([1,9,5])        --: ([1: in[] + out[], 5: in[] + out[], 9: in[] + out[]], [])
graph([node(0), node(1), node(2)]      // if node is a species
graph(['a'::345, 'b'::13])  --:  ([b: in[] + out[b::13], a: in[] + out[a::345], 13: in[b::13] + out[], 345: in[a::345] + out[]], [a::345=(a,345), b::13=(b,13)])
graph(a_graph)  --: a_graph
graph(node1)    --: null
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{list}{%
\subsection{list}\label{list}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a composite datatype holding an ordered collection of values.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} lists are more or less equivalent to instances of ArrayList in Java (although they are backed up by a specific class). They grow and shrink as needed, can be accessed via an index (see @ or index\_of), support set operations (like union and difference), and provide the modeller with a number of utilities that make it easy to deal with collections of agents (see, for instance, shuffle, reverse,where,sort\_by,\ldots{}).
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} lists can contain values of any datatypes, including other lists. Note, however, that due to limitations in the current parser, lists of lists cannot be declared litteraly; they have to be built using assignments. Lists are also a particular kind of container and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} a set of expressions separated by commas, enclosed in square brackets, like {[}12, 14, `abc', self{]}. An empty list is noted \href{}{}.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} lists can be build litteraly from a point, or a string, or any other element by using the list casting operator.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
list (1) -> [1]
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
list<int> myList <- [1,2,3,4]; 
myList[2] => 3
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{map}{%
\subsection{map}\label{map}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a composite datatype holding an ordered collection of pairs (a key, and its associated value).
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    keys (type = list): the list of all keys
  \item
    values (type = list): the list of all values
  \item
    pairs (type = list of pairs): the list of all pairs key::value
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} maps are more or less equivalent to instances of Hashtable in Java (although they are backed up by a specific class).
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} maps can contain values of any datatypes, including other maps or lists. Maps are also a particular kind of container and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} a set of pair expressions separated by commas, enclosed in square brackets; each pair is represented by a key and a value sperarated by `::'. An example of map is {[}agentA::`big', agentB::`small', agentC::`big'{]}. An empty map is noted \href{}{}.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} lists can be built litteraly from a point, or a string, or any other element by using the map casting operator.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
map (1) -> [1::1]
map ({1,5}) -> [x::1, y::5]
[]   // empty map 
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{matrix}{%
\subsection{matrix}\label{matrix}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a composite datatype that represents either a two-dimension array (matrix) or a one-dimension array (vector), holding any type of data (including other matrices).
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} Matrices are fixed-size structures that can be accessed by index (point for two-dimensions matrices, integer for vectors).
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} Matrices cannot be defined literally. One-dimensions matrices can be built by using the matrix casting operator applied on a list. Two-dimensions matrices need to to be declared as variables first, before being filled.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
//builds a one-dimension matrix, of size 5
matrix mat1 <- matrix ([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]);
//  builds a two-dimensions matrix with 10 columns and 5 rows, where each cell is initialized to 0.0
matrix mat2 <- 0.0 as_matrix({10,5}); 
// builds a two-dimensions matrix with 2 columns and 3 rows, with initialized cells
matrix mat3 <- matrix([["c11","c12","c13"],["c21","c22","c23"]]);     
    -> c11;c21
       c12;c22
       c13;c23
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{pair}{%
\subsection{pair}\label{pair}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype holding a key and its associated value.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    key (type = string): the key of the pair, i.e.~the first element of the pair
  \item
    value (type = string): the value of the pair, i.e.~the second element of the pair
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} pairs are also a particular kind of container and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} a pair is defined by a key and a value sperarated by `::'.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} a pair can also be built from:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a point,
  \item
    a map (in this case the first element of the pair is the list of all the keys of the map and the second element is the list of all the values of the map),
  \item
    a list (in this case the two first element of the list are used to built the pair)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
pair testPair <- "key"::56;
pair testPairPoint <- {3,5};             // 3::5
pair testPairList2 <- [6,7,8];           // 6::7
pair testPairMap <- [2::6,5::8,12::45];  // [12,5,2]::[45,8,6]
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{path}{%
\subsection{path}\label{path}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype representing a path linking two agents or geometries in a graph.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    source (type = point): the source point, i.e.~the first point of the path
  \item
    target (type = point): the target point, i.e.~the last point of the path
  \item
    graph (type = graph): the current topology (in the case it is a spatial graph), null otherwise
  \item
    edges (type = list of agents/geometries) : the edges of the graph composing the path
  \item
    vertices (type = list of agents/geometries) : the vertices of the graph composing the path
  \item
    segments (type = list of geometries): the list of the geometries composing the path
  \item
    shape (type = geometry) : the global geometry of the path (polyline)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} the path created between two agents/geometries or locations will strongly depends on the topology in which it is created.
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} a path is \textbf{immutable}, i.e.~it can not be modified after it is created.
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} paths are very barely defined litterally. We can nevertheless use the \texttt{path} unary operator on a list of points to build a path. Operators dedicated to the computation of paths (such as path\_to or path\_between) are often used to build a path.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
path([{1,5},{2,9},{5,8}]) // a path from {1,5} to {5,8} through {2,9}
       
geometry rect <- rectangle(5);
geometry poly <- polygon([{10,20},{11,21},{10,21},{11,22}]);
path pa <- rect path_to poly;  // built a path between rect and poly, in the topolopy   
                                            // of the current agent (i.e. a line in a& continuous topology, 
                                            // a path in a graph  in a graph topology )

a_topology path_between a_container_of_geometries // idem with an explicit topology and the possiblity 
                                                  // to have more than 2 geometries 
                                                  // (the path is then built incrementally)


path_between (a_graph, a_source, a_target) // idem with a the given graph as topology
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{point}{%
\subsection{point}\label{point}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype normally holding two positive float values. Represents the absolute coordinates of agents in the model.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    x (type = float): coordinate of the point on the x-axis
  \item
    y (type = float): coordinate of the point on the y-axis
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} point coordinates should be positive, if a negative value is used in its declaration, the point is built with the absolute value.
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} points are particular cases of geometries and containers. Thus they have also all the built-in attributes of both the geometry and the container datatypes and can be used with every kind of operator or command admitting geometry and container.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} two numbers, separated by a comma, enclosed in braces, like \{12.3, 14.5\}
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} points can be built litteraly from a list, or from an integer or float value by using the point casting operator.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
point ([12,123.45]) -> {12.0, 123.45} 
point (2) -> {2.0, 2.0}

\hypertarget{rgb}{%

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype that represents a color in the RGB space.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    red(type = int): the red component of the color
  \item
    green(type = int): the green component of the color
  \item
    blue(type = int): the blue component of the color
  \item
    darker(type = rgb): a new color that is a darker version of this color
  \item
    brighter(type = rgb): a new color that is a brighter version of this color
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} rgbs are also a particular kind of container and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} there exist lot of ways to declare a color. We use the \texttt{rgb} casting operator applied to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a string. The allowed color names are the constants defined in the Color Java class, i.e.: black, blue, cyan, darkGray, lightGray, gray, green, magenta, orange, pink, red, white, yellow.
  \item
    a list. The integer value associated to the three first elements of the list are used to define the three red (element 0 of the list), green (element 1 of the list) and blue (element 2 of the list) components of the color.
  \item
    a map. The red, green, blue compoenents take the value associated to the keys ``r'', ``g'', ``b'' in the map.
  \item
    an integer \textless{}- the decimal integer is translated into a hexadecimal \textless{}- OxRRGGBB. The red (resp. green, blue) component of the color take the value RR (resp. GG, BB) translated in decimal.
  \item
    Since GAMA 1.6.1, colors can be directly obtained like units, by using the ° or \# symbol followed by the name in lowercase of one of the 147 CSS colors (see \url{http://www.cssportal.com/css3-color-names/}).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
rgb cssRed <- #red;   // Since 1.6.1
rgb testColor <- rgb('white');                 // rgb [255,255,255]
rgb test <- rgb(3,5,67);                     // rgb [3,5,67]
rgb te <- rgb(340);                            // rgb [0,1,84]
rgb tete <- rgb(["r"::34, "g"::56, "b"::345]); // rgb [34,56,255]

\item
  Litteral declaration: the name of a declared species is already a litteral declaration of species.

\hypertarget{species-names-as-types}{%
\subsection{Species names as types}\label{species-names-as-types}}

Once a species has been declared in a model, it automatically becomes a datatype. This means that :
* It can be used to declare variables, parameters or constants,
* It can be used as an operand to commands or operators that require species parameters,
* It can be used as a casting operator (with the same capabilities as the built-in type agent)

In the simple following example, we create a set of ``humans'' and initialize a random ``friendship network'' among them. See how the name of the species, human, is used in the create command, as an argument to the list casting operator, and as the type of the variable named friend.

\begin{verbatim}
global {
    init {
         create human number: 10;
         ask human {
               friend <- one_of (human - self);
         }
     }

\hypertarget{topology}{%

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a topology is basically on neighborhoods, distance,\ldots{} structures in which agents evolves. It is the environment or the context in which all these values are computed. It also provides the access to the spatial index shared by all the agents. And it maintains a (eventually dynamic) link with the `environment' which is a geometrical border.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    places(type = container): the collection of places (geometry) defined by this topology.
  \item
    environment(type = geometry): the environment of this topology (i.e.~the geometry that defines its boundaries)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} the attributes \texttt{places} depends on the kind of the considered topolopy. For continuous topologies, it is a list with their environment. For discrete topologies, it can be any of the container supporting the inclusion of geometries (list, graph, map, matrix)
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} There exist various kinds of topology: continuous topology and discrete topology (e.g.~grid, graph\ldots{})
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} To create a topology, we can use the \texttt{topology} unary casting operator applied to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    an agent: returns a continuous topology built from the agent's geometry
  \item
    a species name: returns the topology defined for this species population
  \item
    a geometry: returns a continuous topology built on this geometry
  \item
    a geometry container (list, map, shapefile): returns an half-discrete (with corresponding places), half-continuous topology (to compute distances\ldots{})
  \item
    a geometry matrix (i.e.~a grid): returns a grid topology which computes specifically neighborhood and distances
  \item
    a geometry graph: returns a graph topology which computes specifically neighborhood and distances
    More complex topologies can also be built using dedicated operators, e.g.~to decompose a geometry\ldots{}

\hypertarget{defining-custom-types}{%
\section{Defining custom types}\label{defining-custom-types}}

Sometimes, besides the species of agents that compose the model, it can be necessary to declare custom datatypes. Species serve this purpose as well, and can be seen as ``classes'' that can help to instantiate simple ``objects''. In the following example, we declare a new kind of ``object'', bottle, that lacks the skills habitually associated with agents (moving, visible, etc.), but can nevertheless group together attributes and behaviors within the same closure. The following example demonstrates how to create the species:

\begin{verbatim}
species bottle {
    float volume <- 0.0 max:1 min:0.0;
    bool is_empty -> {volume = 0.0};
    action fill {
         volume <- 1.0;
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

How to use this species to declare new bottles :

\begin{verbatim}
create bottle {
    volume <- 0.5;
}
\end{verbatim}

And how to use bottles as any other agent in a species (a drinker owns a bottle; when he gets thirsty, it drinks a random quantity from it; when it is empty, it refills it):

\begin{verbatim}
species drinker {
     ...
    bottle my_bottle<- nil;
    float quantity <- rnd (100) / 100;
    bool thirsty <- false update: flip (0.1);
    ...
    action drink {
         if condition: ! bottle.is_empty {
              bottle.volume <-bottle.volume - quantity;
              thirsty <- false;
         }
    }
    ...
    init {
          create bottle return: created_bottle;
              volume <- 0.5;
          }
          my_bottle <- first(created_bottle);
    }
    ...
    reflex filling_bottle when: bottle.is_empty {
         ask  my_bottle {
              do fill;
         }
    }
    ...
    reflex drinking when: thirsty {
         do drink;
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{file-types}{%
\chapter{File Types}\label{file-types}}

GAMA provides modelers with a generic type for files called \textbf{file}. It is possible to load a file using the \emph{file} operator:

\begin{verbatim}
file my_file <- file("../includes/data.csv");
\end{verbatim}

However, internally, GAMA makes the difference between the different types of files.
Indeed, for instance:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
    init {
        file my_file <- file("../includes/data.csv");
        loop el over: my_file {
            write el;
        }
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

will give:

\begin{verbatim}
sepallength
sepalwidth
petallength
petalwidth
type
5.1
3.5
1.4
0.2
Iris-setosa
4.9
3.0
1.4
0.2
Iris-setosa
...
\end{verbatim}

Indeed, the content of CSV file is a matrix: each row of the matrix is a line of the file; each column of the matrix is value delimited by the separator (by default ``,'').

In contrary:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
    init {
        file my_file <- file("../includes/data.shp");
        loop el over: my_file {
            write el;
        }
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

will give:

\begin{verbatim}
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
\end{verbatim}

The content of a shapefile is a list of geometries corresponding to the objects of the shapefile.

In order to know how to load a file, GAMA analyzes its extension. For instance for a file with a ``.csv'' extension, GAMA knows that the file is a \textbf{csv} one and will try to split each line with the \emph{,} separator. However, if the modeler wants to split each line with a different separator (for instance \textbf{;}) or load it as a text file, he/she will have to use a specific file operator.

Indeed, GAMA integrates specific operators corresponding to different types of files.

* .shx --- shape index format; a positional index of the feature geometry to allow seeking forwards and backwards quickly
* .dbf --- attribute format; columnar attributes for each shape, in dBase IV format

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Optional files :

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    .prj --- projection format; the coordinate system and projection information, a plain text file describing the projection using well-known text format
  \item
    .sbn and .sbx --- a spatial index of the features
  \item
    .fbn and .fbx --- a spatial index of the features for shapefiles that are read-only
  \item
    .ain and .aih --- an attribute index of the active fields in a table
  \item
    .ixs --- a geocoding index for read-write shapefiles
  \item
    .mxs --- a geocoding index for read-write shapefiles (ODB format)
  \item
    .atx --- an attribute index for the .dbf file in the form of shapefile.columnname.atx (ArcGIS 8 and later)
  \item
    .shp.xml --- geospatial metadata in XML format, such as ISO 19115 or other XML schema
  \item
    .cpg --- used to specify the code page (only for .dbf) for identifying the character encoding to be used

More details about Esri ASCII grid file can be found \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid}{here}.

Note that grid files can be used to initialize a grid species. The number of rows and columns will be read from the file. Similarly, the values of each cell contained in the grid file will be accessible through the \textbf{grid\_value} attribute.

\begin{verbatim}
grid cell file: grid_file {
}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extensions-4}{%
\subsection{Extensions}\label{extensions-4}}

Here the list of possible extension for grid file:
* ``asc''

\hypertarget{content-4}{%
\subsection{Content}\label{content-4}}

The content of a grid file is a list of geometries corresponding to the cells of the grid.
For example:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
    init {
        file my_file <- grid_file("../includes/data.asc");
        loop el over: my_file {
            write el;
        }
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

will give:

\begin{verbatim}
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
...
\end{verbatim}

Note that the values of each cell of the grid file is stored in their corresponding GAMA geometry (\textbf{grid\_value} attribute). The operator ``get'' (or ``read'') allows to get the value of this attribute.

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
file my_file <- grid_file("../includes/data.asc");
write "my_file: " + my_file.contents;
loop el over: my_file {
    write el get "grid_value";
}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{operators-4}{%

\hypertarget{pseudo-variables}{%
\chapter{Pseudo-variables}\label{pseudo-variables}}

The expressions known as \textbf{pseudo-variables} are special read-only variables that are not declared anywhere (at least not in a species), and which represent a value that changes depending on the context of execution.

\hypertarget{table-of-contents-3}{%
\section{Table of contents}\label{table-of-contents-3}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{pseudo-variables}{Pseudo-variables}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{self}{self}
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{myself}{myself}
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{each}{each}
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{super}{super}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{self}{%
\section{self}\label{self}}

The pseudo-variable \texttt{self} always holds a reference to the agent executing the current statement.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Example (sets the \texttt{friend} attribute of another random agent of the same species to \texttt{self} and conversely):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
friend potential_friend <- one_of (species(self) - self);
if potential_friend != nil {
    potential_friend.friend <- self;
    friend <- potential_friend;
}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{super}{%
\section{super}\label{super}}

The pseudo-variable \texttt{super} behaves exactly in the same way as \texttt{self} except when calling an action, in which case it represents an indirection to the parent species. It is mainly used for allowing to call inherited actions within redefined ones. For instance:

\begin{verbatim}
species parent {

    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

}

species child parent: parent {

    int add(int a, int b) {
        // Calls the action defined in 'parent' with modified arguments
        return super.add(a + 20, b + 20);
    }

}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{myself}{%
\section{myself}\label{myself}}

\texttt{myself} plays the same role as \texttt{self} but in remotely-executed code (\texttt{ask}, \texttt{create}, \texttt{capture} and \texttt{release} statements), where it represents the \emph{calling} agent when the code is executed by the \emph{remote} agent.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Example (asks the first agent of my species to set its color to my color):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
ask first (species (self)){
    color <- myself.color;
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Example (create 10 new agents of the species of my species, share the energy between them, turn them towards me, and make them move 4 times to get closer to me):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
create species (self) number: 10 {
   energy <- myself.energy / 10.0;
   loop times: 4 {
       heading <- towards (myself);
       do move;
   }
}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{each}{%
\section{each}\label{each}}

\texttt{each} is available only in the right-hand argument of \href{Operators\#Iterator-operators}{iterators}. It is a pseudo-variable that represents, in turn, each of the elements of the left-hand container. It can then take any type depending on the context.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Example:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
    list<string> names <- my_species collect each.name;  // each is of type my_species
    int max <- max(['aa', 'bbb', 'cccc'] collect length(each)); // each is of type string
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{learn-gaml-beginner--ii}{%
\chapter{Learn GAML (Beginner -II)}\label{learn-gaml-beginner--ii}}

If you are a beginner, the next 7 chapters will introduce you to functions and statements in GAML language. Before you read these chapters it is important you know what are data types. To learn the language, follow this recommended sequence:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Operators (9-15) : This includes 6 chapters introducing you to all the operators (A to Z) in GAMA. Go first to the chapter \textbf{opeators by categories} to get a feel of the scope of operators available.
  Operators are typically like functions in other languages. They accept one or more arguments of the basic or complex data types and return a result in one of the data types.
\item
  Statements (16) : Statement is a one-line sequence of keywords (commands) guided with controlling arguments (facets) that operate on one of the data types or a combination of operators and data types. A typical example is:
\item
  if you want an agent1 at location A to go to a location B, then the following is a valid GAML statement
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{do} \KeywordTok{goto}\NormalTok{ target:}\KeywordTok{B}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if you want an agent1 at location A to go to a location B with a speed of S, then the following is a GAML valid statement
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{do} \KeywordTok{goto}\NormalTok{ target:}\KeywordTok{B}\NormalTok{ speed:}\KeywordTok{S}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if you want an agent1 at location A to go to a location B with a speed of S on a graph G, then the following is a GAML valid statement
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{do} \KeywordTok{goto}\NormalTok{ target:}\KeywordTok{B}\NormalTok{ speed:}\KeywordTok{S}\NormalTok{ on:}\KeywordTok{G}
\end{Highlighting}

\chapter{Operators (A to A)}\label{operators-a-to-a}}

\hypertarget{definition}{%
\section{Definition}\label{definition}}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical (\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair (\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators (\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}} or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators:
* if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1)})
* if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used.
* if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the \texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.

\hypertarget{priority-between-operators}{%
\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators}}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely:
* the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, \texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return a list of boolean values.
* it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator, the functional if-else (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the result of the if-else).
* next are the logical operators, \texttt{and} and \texttt{or} (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the value of the test)
* next are the comparison operators (i.e. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=}, \texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=})
* next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators)
* next the unary operators \texttt{-} and \texttt{!}
* next the access operators \texttt{.} and \texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points)
* and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.

\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators}}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is \texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type \texttt{unknown} (e.g. \texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

\hypertarget{definition-1}{%
\section{Definition}\label{definition-1}}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical (\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair (\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators (\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}} or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators:
* if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1)})
* if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used.
* if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the \texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.

\hypertarget{section-19}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{}{ }}\label{section-19}}

\hypertarget{priority-between-operators-1}{%
\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators-1}}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely:
* the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, \texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return a list of boolean values.
* it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator, the functional if-else (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the result of the if-else).
* next are the logical operators, \texttt{and} and \texttt{or} (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the value of the test)
* next are the comparison operators (i.e. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=}, \texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=})
* next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators)
* next the unary operators \texttt{-} and \texttt{!}
* next the access operators \texttt{.} and \texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points)
* and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.

\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators-1}}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is \texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type \texttt{unknown} (e.g. \texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

\section{Definition}\label{definition-2}}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical (\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair (\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators (\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}} or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators:
* if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1)})
* if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used.
* if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the \texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.

\hypertarget{priority-between-operators-2}{%
\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators-2}}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely:
* the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, \texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return a list of boolean values.
* it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator, the functional if-else (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the result of the if-else).
* next are the logical operators, \texttt{and} and \texttt{or} (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the value of the test)
* next are the comparison operators (i.e. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=}, \texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=})
* next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators)
* next the unary operators \texttt{-} and \texttt{!}
* next the access operators \texttt{.} and \texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points)
* and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.

\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators-2}}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is \texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type \texttt{unknown} (e.g. \texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

converts a string to a date following a custom pattern and a specific locale (e.g. `fr', `en'\ldots{}). The pattern can use ``\%Y \%M \%N \%D \%E \%h \%m \%s \%z'' for parsing years, months, name of month, days, name of days, hours, minutes, seconds and the time-zone. A null or empty pattern will parse the date using one of the ISO date \& time formats (similar to date(`\ldots{}') in that case). The pattern can also follow the pattern definition found here, which gives much more control over what will be parsed: \url{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html\#patterns}. Different patterns are available by default as constant: \#iso\_local, \#iso\_simple, \#iso\_offset, \#iso\_zoned and \#custom, which can be changed in the preferences

The index of the best candidate according to a method based on the ELECTRE methods. The principle of the ELECTRE methods is to compare the possible candidates by pair. These methods analyses the possible outranking relation existing between two candidates. An candidate outranks another if this one is at least as good as the other one. The ELECTRE methods are based on two concepts: the concordance and the discordance. The concordance characterizes the fact that, for an outranking relation to be validated, a sufficient majority of criteria should be in favor of this assertion. The discordance characterizes the fact that, for an outranking relation to be validated, none of the criteria in the minority should oppose too strongly this assertion. These two conditions must be true for validating the outranking assertion. More information about the ELECTRE methods can be found in {[}\url{http://www.springerlink.com/content/g367r44322876223/} Figueira, J., Mousseau, V., Roy, B.: ELECTRE Methods. In: Figueira, J., Greco, S., and Ehrgott, M., (Eds.), Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys, Springer, New York, 133--162 (2005){]}. The first operand is the list of candidates (a candidate is a list of criterion values); the second operand the list of criterion: A criterion is a map that contains fives elements: a name, a weight, a preference value (p), an indifference value (q) and a veto value (v). The preference value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values allows to prefer one vector of values over another. The indifference value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values is considered significant. The veto value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values disqualifies the candidate that obtained the smaller value; the last operand is the fuzzy cut.

\chapter{Operators (I to M)}\label{operators-i-to-m}}

\hypertarget{definition-3}{%
\section{Definition}\label{definition-3}}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical (\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair (\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators (\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}} or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators:
* if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1)})
* if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used.
* if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the \texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.

\hypertarget{section-21}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{}{ }}\label{section-21}}

\hypertarget{priority-between-operators-3}{%
\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators-3}}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely:
* the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, \texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return a list of boolean values.
* it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator, the functional if-else (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the result of the if-else).
* next are the logical operators, \texttt{and} and \texttt{or} (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the value of the test)
* next are the comparison operators (i.e. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=}, \texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=})
* next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators)
* next the unary operators \texttt{-} and \texttt{!}
* next the access operators \texttt{.} and \texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points)
* and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.

\hypertarget{using-actions-as-operators-3}{%
\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators-3}}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is \texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type \texttt{unknown} (e.g. \texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

\hypertarget{definition-4}{%
\section{Definition}\label{definition-4}}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical (\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair (\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators (\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}} or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators:
* if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1)})
* if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used.
* if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the \texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.

\section{\texorpdfstring{}{ }}\label{section-22}}

\hypertarget{priority-between-operators-4}{%
\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators-4}}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely:
* the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, \texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return a list of boolean values.
* it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator, the functional if-else (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the result of the if-else).
* next are the logical operators, \texttt{and} and \texttt{or} (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the value of the test)
* next are the comparison operators (i.e. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=}, \texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=})
* next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators)
* next the unary operators \texttt{-} and \texttt{!}
* next the access operators \texttt{.} and \texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points)
* and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.

\hypertarget{using-actions-as-operators-4}{%
\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators-4}}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is \texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type \texttt{unknown} (e.g. \texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

\section{Definition}\label{definition-5}}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical (\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair (\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators (\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}} or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators:
* if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1)})
* if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used.
* if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the \texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.

\hypertarget{priority-between-operators-5}{%
\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators-5}}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely:
* the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, \texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return a list of boolean values.
* it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator, the functional if-else (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the result of the if-else).
* next are the logical operators, \texttt{and} and \texttt{or} (e.g. \texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the value of the test)
* next are the comparison operators (i.e. \texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=}, \texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=})
* next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators)
* next the unary operators \texttt{-} and \texttt{!}
* next the access operators \texttt{.} and \texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g. \texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points)
* and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.

\hypertarget{using-actions-as-operators-5}{%
\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators-5}}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is \texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type \texttt{unknown} (e.g. \texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

\hypertarget{general-syntax}{%
\section{General syntax}\label{general-syntax}}

A statement represents either a declaration or an imperative command. It consists in a keyword, followed by specific facets, some of them mandatory (in bold), some of them optional. One of the facet names can be omitted (the one denoted as omissible). It has to be the first one.

\begin{verbatim}
statement_keyword expression1 facet2: expression2 ... ;
or
statement_keyword facet1: expression1 facet2: expression2 ...;
\end{verbatim}

If the statement encloses other statements, it is called a \textbf{sequence statement}, and its sub-statements (either sequence statements or single statements) are declared between curly brackets, as in:

\begin{verbatim}
statement_keyword1 expression1 facet2: expression2... { // a sequence statement
     statement_keyword2 expression1 facet2: expression2...;  // a single statement
     statement_keyword3 expression1 facet2: expression2...;
}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{facets}{%

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{right}} (float), (omissible) : the right part of the equation (it is mandatory that it can be evaluated as a float\\
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{left}} (any type): the left part of the equation (it should be a variable or a call to the diff() or diff2() operators)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{definition-6}{%
\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-6}}

Allows to implement an equation in the form function(n, t) = expression. The left function is only here as a placeholder for enabling a simpler syntax and grabbing the variable as its left member.

\hypertarget{usages}{%
\subsubsection{Usages}\label{usages}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The syntax of the = statement is a bit different from the other statements. It has to be used as follows (in an equation):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
float t; float S; float I; equation SI {     diff(S,t) = (- 0.3 * S * I / 100);    diff(I,t) = (0.3 * S * I / 100); }  ```

    
* See also: [equation](#equation), [solve](#solve), 

#### Embedments
* The `=` statement is of type: **Single statement**
* The `=` statement can be embedded into: equation, 
* The `=` statement embeds statements: 

----

[//]: # (keyword|statement_action)
### action 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`name`** (an identifier), (omissible) : identifier of the action
  * `index` (a datatype identifier): if the action returns a map, the type of its keys
  * `of` (a datatype identifier): if the action returns a container, the type of its elements
  * `type` (a datatype identifier): the action returned type
  * `virtual` (boolean): whether the action is virtual (defined without a set of instructions) (false by default) 
    
#### Definition

Allows to define in a species, model or experiment a new action that can be called elsewhere.

#### Usages

* The simplest syntax to define an action that does not take any parameter and does not return anything is:

action simple\_action \{ // {[}set of statements{]} \} ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the action needs some parameters, they can be specified betwee, braquets after the identifier of the action:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
action action_parameters(int i, string s){    // [set of statements using i and s] } ```


* If the action returns any value, the returned type should be used instead of the "action" keyword. A return statement inside the body of the action statement is mandatory.
\end{verbatim}

int action\_return\_val(int i, string s)\{ // {[}set of statements using i and s{]} return i + i; \} ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If virtual: is true, then the action is abstract, which means that the action is defined without body. A species containing at least one abstract action is abstract. Agents of this species cannot be created. The common use of an abstract action is to define an action that can be used by all its sub-species, which should redefine all abstract actions and implements its body.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
species parent_species {    int virtual_action(int i, string s); }  species children parent: parent_species {    int virtual_action(int i, string s) {       return i + i;    } } ```

[//]: # (keyword|statement_add)
### add 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`to`** (any type in [container, species, agent, geometry]): an expression that evaluates to a container
  * `item` (any type), (omissible) : any expression to add in the container
  * `all` (any type): Allows to either pass a container so as to add all its element, or 'true', if the item to add is already a container.
  * `at` (any type): position in the container of added element
  * `edge` (any type): a pair that will be added to a graph as an edge (if nodes do not exist, they are also added)
  * `node` (any type): an expression that will be added to a graph as a node.
  * `vertex` (any type): 
  * `weight` (float): An optional float value representing the weight to attach to this element in case the container is a graph 
    
#### Definition

Allows to add, i.e. to insert, a new element in a container (a list, matrix, map, ...).Incorrect use: The addition of a new element at a position out of the bounds of the container will produce a warning and let the container unmodified. If all: is specified, it has no effect if its argument is not a container, or if its argument is 'true' and the item to add is not a container. In that latter case

#### Usages

* The new element can be added either at the end of the container or at a particular position.
\end{verbatim}

add expr to: expr\_container; // Add at the end add expr at: expr to: expr\_container; // Add at position expr ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Case of a list, the expression in the facet at: should be an integer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
list<int> workingList <- []; add 0 at: 0 to: workingList ;//workingList equals [0]add 10 at: 0 to: workingList ;//workingList equals [10,0]add 20 at: 2 to: workingList ;//workingList equals [10,0,20]add 50 to: workingList;//workingList equals [10,0,20,50]add [60,70] all: true to: workingList;//workingList equals [10,0,20,50,60,70]```


* Case of a map: As a map is basically a list of pairs key::value, we can also use the add statement on it. It is important to note that the behavior of the statement is slightly different, in particular in the use of the at facet, which denotes the key of the pair.
\end{verbatim}

map\textless{}string,string\textgreater{} workingMap \textless{}- {[}{]}; add ``val1'' at: ``x'' to: workingMap;//workingMap equals {[}``x''::``val1''{]}```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the at facet is omitted, a pair expr\_item::expr\_item will be added to the map. An important exception is the case where the expr\_item is a pair: in this case the pair is added.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
add "val2" to: workingMap;//workingMap equals ["x"::"val1", "val2"::"val2"]add "5"::"val4" to: workingMap; //workingMap equals ["x"::"val1", "val2"::"val2", "5"::"val4"]```


* Notice that, as the key should be unique, the addition of an item at an existing position (i.e. existing key) will only modify the value associated with the given key.
\end{verbatim}

add ``val3'' at: ``x'' to: workingMap;//workingMap equals {[}``x''::``val3'', ``val2''::``val2'', ``5''::``val4''{]}```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On a map, the all facet will add all value of a container in the map (so as pair val\_cont::val\_cont)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
add ["val4","val5"] all: true at: "x" to: workingMap;//workingMap equals ["x"::"val3", "val2"::"val2", "5"::"val4","val4"::"val4","val5"::"val5"]```


* In case of a graph, we can use the facets `node`, `edge` and `weight` to add a node, an edge or weights to the graph. However, these facets are now considered as deprecated, and it is advised to use the various edge(), node(), edges(), nodes() operators, which can build the correct objects to add to the graph 
\end{verbatim}

graph g \textless{}- as\_edge\_graph({[}\{1,5\}::\{12,45\}{]}); add edge: \{1,5\}::\{2,3\} to: g;\\
list var \textless{}- g.vertices; // var equals {[}\{1,5\},\{12,45\},\{2,3\}{]}
list var \textless{}- g.edges; // var equals {[}polyline(\{1.0,5.0\}::\{12.0,45.0\}),polyline(\{1.0,5.0\}::\{2.0,3.0\}){]}add node: \{5,5\} to: g;\\
list var \textless{}- g.vertices; // var equals {[}\{1.0,5.0\},\{12.0,45.0\},\{2.0,3.0\},\{5.0,5.0\}{]}
list var \textless{}- g.edges; // var equals {[}polyline(\{1.0,5.0\}::\{12.0,45.0\}),polyline(\{1.0,5.0\}::\{2.0,3.0\}){]}```

\item
  \texttt{position} (point): position of the upper-left corner of the layer. Note that if coordinates are in {[}0,1{[}, the position is relative to the size of the environment (e.g. \{0.5,0.5\} refers to the middle of the display) whereas it is absolute when coordinates are greater than 1 for x and y. The z-ordinate can only be defined between 0 and 1. The position can only be a 3D point \{0.5, 0.5, 0.5\}, the last coordinate specifying the elevation of the layer.
\item
  \texttt{refresh} (boolean): (openGL only) specify whether the display of the species is refreshed. (true by default, useful in case of agents that do not move)
\item
  \texttt{selectable} (boolean): Indicates whether the agents present on this layer are selectable by the user. Default is true
\item
  \texttt{size} (point): extent of the layer in the screen from its position. Coordinates in {[}0,1{[} are treated as percentages of the total surface, while coordinates \textgreater{} 1 are treated as absolute sizes in model units (i.e.~considering the model occupies the entire view). Like in `position', an elevation can be provided with the z coordinate, allowing to scale the layer in the 3 directions
\item
  \texttt{trace} (any type in {[}boolean, int{]}): Allows to aggregate the visualization of agents at each timestep on the display. Default is false. If set to an int value, only the last n-th steps will be visualized. If set to true, no limit of timesteps is applied.
\item

Note that if coordinates are in [0,1[, the position is relative to the size of the environment (e.g. {0.5,0.5} refers to the middle of the display) whereas it is absolute when coordinates are greater than 1 for x and y. The z-ordinate can only be defined between 0 and 1. The position can only be a 3D point {0.5, 0.5, 0.5}, the last coordinate specifying the elevation of the layer.
  * `reverse_axes` (boolean): reverse X and Y axis (for example to get horizental bar charts
  * `series_label_position` (an identifier), takes values in: {default, none, legend, onchart, yaxis, xaxis}: Position of the Series names: default (best guess), none, legend, onchart, xaxis (for category plots) or yaxis (uses the first serie name).
  * `size` (point): the layer resize factor: {1,1} refers to the original size whereas {0.5,0.5} divides by 2 the height and the width of the layer. In case of a 3D layer, a 3D point can be used (note that {1,1} is equivalent to {1,1,0}, so a resize of a layer containing 3D objects with a 2D points will remove the elevation)
  * `style` (an identifier), takes values in: {line, whisker, area, bar, dot, step, spline, stack, 3d, ring, exploded, default}: The sub-style style, also default style for the series.
  * `tick_font` (string): Tick font face

It could be histogram, series, xy, pie, radar, heatmap or box whisker. The difference between series and xy is that the former adds an implicit x-axis that refers to the numbers of cycles, while the latter considers the first declaration of data to be its x-axis.
  * `x_label` (string): the title for the X axis
  * `x_log_scale` (boolean): use Log Scale for X axis
  * `x_range` (any type in [float, int, point, list]): range of the x-axis. Can be a number (which will set the axis total range) or a point (which will set the min and max of the axis).

### create 
#### Facets 

  * `species` (any type in [species, agent]), (omissible) : an expression that evaluates to a species, the species of the agents to be created. In the case of simulations, the name 'simulation', which represents the current instance of simulation, can also be used as a proxy to their species
  * `as` (species): 
  * `from` (any type): an expression that evaluates to a localized entity, a list of localized entities, a string (the path of a file), a file (shapefile, a .csv, a .asc or a OSM file) or a container returned by a request to a database
  * `header` (boolean): an expression that evaluates to a boolean, when creating agents from csv file, specify whether the file header is loaded
  * `number` (int): an expression that evaluates to an int, the number of created agents
  * `returns` (a new identifier): a new temporary variable name containing the list of created agents (a list, even if only one agent has been created)
  * `with` (map): an expression that evaluates to a map, for each pair the key is a species attribute and the value the assigned value 
    
#### Definition

Allows an agent to create `number` agents of species `species`, to create agents of species `species` from a shapefile or to create agents of species `species` from one or several localized entities (discretization of the localized entity geometries).

#### Usages

* Its simple syntax to create `an_int` agents of species `a_species` is:
\end{verbatim}

create a\_species number: an\_int; create species\_of(self) number: 5 returns: list5Agents; 5 ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In GAML modelers can create agents of species \texttt{a\_species\ \ (with\ two\ attributes}type\texttt{and}nature\texttt{with\ types\ corresponding\ to\ the\ types\ of\ the\ shapefile\ attributes)\ from\ a\ shapefile}the\_shapefile` while reading attributes `TYPE\_OCC' and `NATURE' of the shapefile. One agent will be created by object contained in the shapefile:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
create a_species from: the_shapefile with: [type:: read('TYPE_OCC'), nature::read('NATURE')]; ```


* In order to create agents from a .csv file, facet `header` can be used to specified whether we can use columns header:
\end{verbatim}

create toto from: ``toto.csv'' header: true with:{[}att1::read(``NAME''), att2::read(``TYPE''){]}; or create toto from: ``toto.csv'' with:{[}att1::read(0), att2::read(1){]}; //with read(int), the index of the column ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Similarly to the creation from shapefile, modelers can create agents from a set of geometries. In this case, one agent per geometry will be created (with the geometry as shape)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
create species_of(self) from: [square(4),circle(4)];    // 2 agents have been created, with shapes respectively square(4) and circle(4) ```


* Created agents are initialized following the rules of their species. If one wants to refer to them after the statement is executed, the returns keyword has to be defined: the agents created will then be referred to by the temporary variable it declares. For instance, the following statement creates 0 to 4 agents of the same species as the sender, and puts them in the temporary variable children for later use.
\end{verbatim}

create species (self) number: rnd (4) returns: children; ask children \{ // \ldots{} \} ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If one wants to specify a special initialization sequence for the agents created, create provides the same possibilities as ask. This extended syntax is:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
create a_species number: an_int {      [statements] } ```


* The same rules as in ask apply. The only difference is that, for the agents created, the assignments of variables will bypass the initialization defined in species. For instance:
\end{verbatim}

create species(self) number: rnd (4) returns: children \{ set location \textless{}- myself.location + \{rnd (2), rnd (2)\}; // tells the children to be initially located close to me set parent \textless{}- myself; // tells the children that their parent is me (provided the variable parent is declared in this species) \} ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Desprecated uses:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
// Simple syntax create species: a_species number: an_int;  ```


* If `number` equals 0 or species is not a species, the statement is ignored.

### diffuse 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`var`** (an identifier), (omissible) : the variable to be diffused  
  * **`on`** (any type in [container, species]): the list of agents (in general cells of a grid), on which the diffusion will occur

If false, the value will be diffused in the masked cells, but masked cells won't diffuse the value afterward (lost of signal). (default value : false)
  * `cycle_length` (int): the number of diffusion operation applied in one simulation step
  * `mask` (matrix): a matrix masking the diffusion (matrix created from a image for example). The cells corresponding to the values smaller than "-1" in the mask matrix will not diffuse, and the other will diffuse.
  * `mat_diffu` (matrix): the diffusion matrix (can have any size)
  * `matrix` (matrix): the diffusion matrix ("kernel" or "filter" in image processing). Can have any size, as long as dimensions are odd values.
  * `method` (an identifier), takes values in: {convolution, dot_product}: the diffusion method
  * `min_value` (float): if a value is smaller than this value, it will not be diffused. By default, this value is equal to 0.0. This value cannot be smaller than 0.
  * `propagation` (a label), takes values in: {diffusion, gradient}: represents both the way the signal is propagated and the way to treat multiple propagation of the same signal occurring at once from different places. If propagation equals 'diffusion', the intensity of a signal is shared between its neighbors with respect to 'proportion', 'variation' and the number of neighbors of the environment places (4, 6 or 8). I.e., for a given signal S propagated from place P, the value transmitted to its N neighbors is : S' = (S / N / proportion) - variation. The intensity of S is then diminished by S `*` proportion on P. In a diffusion, the different signals of the same name see their intensities added to each other on each place. If propagation equals 'gradient', the original intensity is not modified, and each neighbors receives the intensity : S / proportion - variation. If multiple propagation occur at once, only the maximum intensity is kept on each place. If 'propagation' is not defined, it is assumed that it is equal to 'diffusion'.
  * `proportion` (float): a diffusion rate
  * `radius` (int): a diffusion radius (in number of cells from the center)
  * `variation` (float): an absolute value to decrease at each neighbors 
    
#### Definition

This statements allows a value to diffuse among a species on agents (generally on a grid) depending on a given diffusion matrix.

#### Usages

* A basic example of diffusion of the variable phero defined in the species cells, given a diffusion matrix math_diff is:
\end{verbatim}

matrix math\_diff \textless{}- matrix({[}{[}1/9,1/9,1/9{]},{[}1/9,1/9,1/9{]},{[}1/9,1/9,1/9{]}{]}); diffuse var: phero on: cells mat\_diffu: math\_diff; ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The diffusion can be masked by obstacles, created from a bitmap image:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
diffuse var: phero on: cells mat_diffu: math_diff mask: mymask; ```


* A convenient way to have an uniform diffusion in a given radius is (which is equivalent to the above diffusion):
\end{verbatim}

diffuse var: phero on: cells proportion: 1/9 radius: 1; ```

#### Facets 
  
  * **`action`** (an identifier), (omissible) : the name of an action or a primitive
  * `internal_function` (any type): 
  * `returns` (a new identifier): create a new variable and assign to it the result of the action
  * `with` (map): a map expression containing the parameters of the action 
    
#### Definition

Allows the agent to execute an action or a primitive.  For a list of primitives available in every species, see this [BuiltIn161 page]; for the list of primitives defined by the different skills, see this [Skills161 page]. Finally, see this [Species161 page] to know how to declare custom actions.

#### Usages

* The simple syntax (when the action does not expect any argument and the result is not to be kept) is:
\end{verbatim}

do name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive; ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In case the action expects one or more arguments to be passed, they are defined by using facets (enclosed tags or a map are now deprecated):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
do name_of_action_or_primitive arg1: expression1 arg2: expression2; ```


* In case the result of the action needs to be made available to the agent, the action can be called with the agent calling the action (`self` when the agent itself calls the action) instead of `do`; the result should be assigned to a temporary variable:
\end{verbatim}

type\_returned\_by\_action result \textless{}- self name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive {[}{]}; ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In case of an action expecting arguments and returning a value, the following syntax is used:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
type_returned_by_action result <- self name_of_action_or_primitive [arg1::expression1, arg2::expression2]; ```


* Deprecated uses: following uses of the `do` statement (still accepted) are now deprecated:
\end{verbatim}

// Simple syntax: do action: name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive; // In case the result of the action needs to be made available to the agent, the \texttt{returns} keyword can be defined; the result will then be referred to by the temporary variable declared in this attribute: do name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive returns: result; do name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive arg1: expression1 arg2: expression2 returns: result; type\_returned\_by\_action result \textless{}- name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive(self, {[}arg1::expression1, arg2::expression2{]}); // In case the result of the action needs to be made available to the agent let result \textless{}- name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive(self, {[}{]}); // In case the action expects one or more arguments to be passed, they can also be defined by using enclosed \texttt{arg} statements, or the \texttt{with} facet with a map of parameters: do name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive with: {[}arg1::expression1, arg2::expression2{]}; or do name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive \{ arg arg1 value: expression1; arg arg2 value: expression2; \ldots{} \} ```

* As other batch methods, the basic syntax of the exhaustive statement uses `method exhaustive` instead of the expected `exhaustive name: id` : 
\end{verbatim}

method exhaustive {[}facet: value{]}; ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For example:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
method exhaustive maximize: food_gathered; ```



#### Embedments
* The `exhaustive` statement is of type: **Batch method**
* The `exhaustive` statement can be embedded into: Experiment, 
* The `exhaustive` statement embeds statements:

#### Definition

In an FSM architecture, `exit` introduces a sequence of statements to execute right before exiting the state.

#### Usages

* In the following example, at the state it leaves the state s_init, he will display the message 'EXIT from s_init':
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
state s_init initial: true {        write state;        transition to: s1 when: (cycle > 2) {           write "transition s_init -> s1";        }       exit {          write "EXIT from "+state;       }   } ```

[//]: # (keyword|statement_loop)
### loop 
#### Facets 

  * `name` (a new identifier), (omissible) : a temporary variable name
  * `from` (int): an int expression
  * `over` (any type in [container, point]): a list, point, matrix or map expression
  * `step` (int): an int expression
  * `times` (int): an int expression
  * `to` (int): an int expression
  * `while` (boolean): a boolean expression 
    
#### Definition

Allows the agent to perform the same set of statements either a fixed number of times, or while a condition is true, or by progressing in a collection of elements or along an interval of integers. Be aware that there are no prevention of infinite loops. As a consequence, open loops should be used with caution, as one agent may block the execution of the whole model.

#### Usages

* The basic syntax for repeating a fixed number of times a set of statements is:
\end{verbatim}

loop times: an\_int\_expression \{ // \protect\hyperlink{statements}{statements} \} ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements while a condition holds is:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
loop while: a_bool_expression {      // [statements] } ```


* The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements by progressing over a container of a point is:
\end{verbatim}

loop a\_temp\_var over: a\_collection\_expression \{ // \protect\hyperlink{statements}{statements} \} ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements while an index iterates over a range of values with a fixed step of 1 is:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
loop a_temp_var from: int_expression_1 to: int_expression_2 {      // [statements] } ```


* The incrementation step of the index can also be chosen:
\end{verbatim}

loop a\_temp\_var from: int\_expression\_1 to: int\_expression\_2 step: int\_expression3 \{ // \protect\hyperlink{statements}{statements} \} ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In these latter three cases, the name facet designates the name of a temporary variable, whose scope is the loop, and that takes, in turn, the value of each of the element of the list (or each value in the interval). For example, in the first instance of the ``loop over'' syntax :
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
int a <- 0; loop i over: [10, 20, 30] {      a <- a + i; } // a now equals 60 ```


* The second (quite common) case of the loop syntax allows one to use an interval of integers. The from and to facets take an integer expression as arguments, with the first (resp. the last) specifying the beginning (resp. end) of the inclusive interval (i.e. [to, from]). If the step is not defined, it is assumed to be equal to 1 or -1, depending on the direction of the range. If it is defined, its sign will be respected, so that a positive step will never allow the loop to enter a loop from i to j where i is greater than j
\end{verbatim}

list the\_list \textless{}-list (species\_of (self)); loop i from: 0 to: length (the\_list) - 1 \{ ask the\_list at i \{ // \ldots{} \} \} // every agent of the list is asked to do something ```

### migrate 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`source`** (any type in [agent, species, container, an identifier]), (omissible) : can be an agent, a list of agents, a agent's population to be migrated  
  * **`target`** (species): target species/population that source agent(s) migrate to.
  * `returns` (a new identifier): the list of returned agents in a new local variable 
    
#### Definition

This command permits agents to migrate from one population/species to another population/species and stay in the same host after the migration. Species of source agents and target species respect the following constraints: (i) they are "peer" species (sharing the same direct macro-species), (ii) they have sub-species vs. parent-species relationship.

#### Usages

* It can be used in a 3-levels model, in case where individual agents can be captured into group meso agents and groups into clouds macro agents. migrate is used to allows agents captured by groups to migrate into clouds. See the model 'Balls, Groups and Clouds.gaml' in the library.

### reactive_tabu 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`name`** (an identifier), (omissible) : 
  * `aggregation` (a label), takes values in: {min, max}: the agregation method
  * `cycle_size_max` (int): minimal size of the considered cycles
  * `cycle_size_min` (int): maximal size of the considered cycles
  * `iter_max` (int): number of iterations
  * `maximize` (float): the value the algorithm tries to maximize

#### Definition

This algorithm is a simple implementation of the Reactive Tabu Search algorithm ((Battiti et al., 1993)). This Reactive Tabu Search is an enhance version of the Tabu search. It adds two new elements to the classic Tabu Search. The first one concerns the size of the tabu list: in the Reactive Tabu Search, this one is not constant anymore but it dynamically evolves according to the context. Thus, when the exploration process visits too often the same solutions, the tabu list is extended in order to favor the diversification of the search process. On the other hand, when the process has not visited an already known solution for a high number of iterations, the tabu list is shortened in order to favor the intensification of the search process. The second new element concerns the adding of cycle detection capacities. Thus, when a cycle is detected, the process applies random movements in order to break the cycle. See [batch161 the batch dedicated page].

#### Usages

* As other batch methods, the basic syntax of the reactive_tabu statement uses `method reactive_tabu` instead of the expected `reactive_tabu name: id` : 
\end{verbatim}

method reactive\_tabu {[}facet: value{]}; ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For example:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
method reactive_tabu iter_max: 50 tabu_list_size_init: 5 tabu_list_size_min: 2 tabu_list_size_max: 10 nb_tests_wthout_col_max: 20 cycle_size_min: 2 cycle_size_max: 20 maximize: food_gathered; ```

### reflex 
#### Facets 

  * `name` (an identifier), (omissible) : the identifier of the reflex
  * `when` (boolean): an expression that evaluates a boolean, the condition to fulfill in order to execute the statements embedded in the reflex. 
    
#### Definition

Reflexes are sequences of statements that can be executed by the agent. Reflexes prefixed by the 'reflex' keyword are executed continuously. Reflexes prefixed by 'init' are executed only immediately after the agent has been created. Reflexes prefixed by 'abort' just before the agent is killed. If a facet when: is defined, a reflex is executed only if the boolean expression evaluates to true.

#### Usages

* Example:
\end{verbatim}

reflex my\_reflex when: flip (0.5)\{ //Only executed when flip returns true write ``Executing the unconditional reflex''; \} ```

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{definition-37}{%
\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-37}}

Allows an agent to release its micro-agent(s). The preliminary for an agent to release its micro-agents is that species of these micro-agents are sub-species of other species (cf. {[}Species161\#Nesting\_species Nesting species{]}). The released agents won't be micro-agents of the calling agent anymore. Being released from a macro-agent, the micro-agents will change their species and host (macro-agent).

\item
  We consider the following species. Agents of ``C'' species can be released from a ``B'' agent to become agents of ``A'' species. Agents of ``D'' species cannot be released from the ``A'' agent because species ``D'' has no parent species.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
species A { ... } species B { ...    species C parent: A {    ...    }    species D {    ...    } ... } ```


* To release all "C" agents from a "B" agent, agent "C" has to execute the following statement. The "C" agent will change to "A" agent. The won't consider "B" agent as their macro-agent (host) anymore. Their host (macro-agent) will the be the host (macro-agent) of the "B" agent.

#### Facets 
  
  * **`from`** (any type in [container, species, agent, geometry]): an expression that evaluates to a container
  * `item` (any type), (omissible) : any expression to remove from the container
  * `all` (any type): an expression that evaluates to a container. If it is true and if the value a list, it removes the first instance of each element of the list. If it is true and the value is not a container, it will remove all instances of this value.
  * `edge` (any type): Indicates that the item to remove should be considered as an edge of the receiving graph
  * `index` (any type): any expression, the key at which to remove the element from the container
  * `key` (any type): any expression, the key at which to remove the element from the container
  * `node` (any type): Indicates that the item to remove should be considered as a node of the receiving graph
  * `vertex` (any type):  
    
#### Definition

Allows the agent to remove an element from a container (a list, matrix, map...).

#### Usages

* This statement should be used in the following ways, depending on the kind of container used and the expected action on it:
\end{verbatim}

remove expr from: expr\_container; remove index: expr from: expr\_container; remove key: expr from: expr\_container; remove all: expr from: expr\_container; ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the case of list, the facet \texttt{item:} is used to remove the first occurence of a given expression, whereas \texttt{all} is used to remove all the occurrences of the given expression.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
list<int> removeList <- [3,2,1,2,3]; remove 2 from: removeList;//removeList equals [3,1,2,3]remove 3 all: true from: removeList;//removeList equals [1,2]remove index: 1 from: removeList;//removeList equals [1]```


* In the case of map, the facet `key:` is used to remove the pair identified by the given key.
\end{verbatim}

map\textless{}string,int\textgreater{} removeMap \textless{}- {[}``x''::5, ``y''::7, ``z''::7{]}; remove key: ``x'' from: removeMap;//removeMap equals {[}``y''::7, ``z''::7{]}remove 7 all: true from: removeMap;//removeMap equals map({[}{]})```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In addition, a map a be managed as a list with pair key as index. Given that, facets item:, all: and index: can be used in the same way:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
map<string,int> removeMapList <- ["x"::5, "y"::7, "z"::7, "t"::5]; remove 7 from: removeMapList;//removeMapList equals ["x"::5, "z"::7, "t"::5]remove [5,7] all: true from: removeMapList;//removeMapList equals ["t"::5]remove index: "t" from: removeMapList;//removeMapList equals map([])```


* In the case of a graph, both edges and nodes can be removes using node: and edge facets. If a node is removed, all edges to and from this node are also removed.
\end{verbatim}

graph removeGraph \textless{}- as\_edge\_graph({[}\{1,2\}::\{3,4\},\{3,4\}::\{5,6\}{]}); remove node: \{1,2\} from: removeGraph; remove node(1,2) from: removeGraph;\\
list var \textless{}- removeGraph.vertices; // var equals {[}\{3,4\},\{5,6\}{]}
list var \textless{}- removeGraph.edges; // var equals {[}polyline(\{3,4\}::\{5,6\}){]}remove edge: \{3,4\}::\{5,6\} from: removeGraph; remove edge(\{3,4\},\{5,6\}) from: removeGraph;\\
list var \textless{}- removeGraph.vertices; // var equals {[}\{3,4\},\{5,6\}{]}
list var \textless{}- removeGraph.edges; // var equals {[}{]}```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the case of an agent or a shape, \texttt{remove} allows to remove an attribute from the attributes map of the receiver. However, for agents, it will only remove attributes that have been added dynamically, not the ones defined in the species or in its built-in parent.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
global {    init {       create speciesRemove;       speciesRemove sR <- speciesRemove(0);  // sR.a now equals 100       remove key:"a" from: sR;   // sR.a now equals nil    } }  species speciesRemove {    int a <- 100;  } ```

#### Definition

Allows to immediately stop and tell which value to return from the evaluation of the surrounding action or top-level statement (reflex, init, etc.). Usually used within the declaration of an action. For more details about actions, see the following [Section161 section].

#### Usages

* Example:
\end{verbatim}

string foo \{ return ``foo''; \} reflex \{ string foo\_result \textless{}- foo(); // foos\_result is now equals to ``foo'' \} ```

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the specific case one wants an agent to ask another agent to execute a statement with a return, it can be done similarly to:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
// In Species A: string foo_different {      return "foo_not_same"; } /// .... // In Species B: reflex writing {     string temp <- some_agent_A.foo_different [];  // temp is now equals to "foo_not_same"  } ```

  \texttt{control} (22): defines the architecture of the species (e.g.~fsm\ldots{})
\item
  \texttt{edge\_species} (species): In the case of a species defining a graph topology for its instances (nodes of the graph), specifies the species to use for representing the edges
\item
  \texttt{file} (file): (grid only), a bitmap file that will be loaded at runtime so that the value of each pixel can be assigned to the attribute `grid\_value'
\item
  \texttt{files} (list): (grid only), a list of bitmap file that will be loaded at runtime so that the value of each pixel of each file can be assigned to the attribute `bands'
\item
  \texttt{frequency} (int): The execution frequency of the species (default value: 1). For instance, if frequency is set to 10, the population of agents will be executed only every 10 cycles.
\item
  \texttt{height} (int): (grid only), the height of the grid (in terms of agent number)
\item
  \texttt{horizontal\_orientation} (boolean): (hexagonal grid only),(true by default). Allows use a hexagonal grid with a horizontal or vertical orientation.
\item
  \texttt{mirrors} (any type in {[}list, species{]}): The species this species is mirroring. The population of this current species will be dependent of that of the species mirrored (i.e.~agents creation and death are entirely taken in charge by GAMA with respect to the demographics of the species mirrored). In addition, this species is provided with an attribute called `target', which allows each agent to know which agent of the mirrored species it is representing.
\item

\item
  \texttt{neighbours} (int): (grid only), the chosen neighborhood (4, 6 or 8)

\item
  \texttt{parallel} (any type in {[}boolean, int{]}): (experimental) setting this facet to `true' will allow this species to use concurrency when scheduling its agents; setting it to an integer will set the threshold under which they will be run sequentially (the default is initially 20, but can be fixed in the preferences). This facet has a default set in the preferences (Under Performances \textgreater{} Concurrency)
\item
  \texttt{parent} (species): the parent class (inheritance)
\item
  \texttt{schedules} (container): A container of agents (a species, a dynamic list, or a combination of species and containers) , which represents which agents will be actually scheduled when the population is scheduled for execution. For instance, `species a schedules: (10 among a)' will result in a population that schedules only 10 of its own agents every cycle. `species b schedules: {[}{]}' will prevent the agents of `b' to be scheduled. Note that the scope of agents covered here can be larger than the population, which allows to build complex scheduling controls; for instance, defining `global schedules: {[}{]} \{\ldots{}\} species b schedules: {[}{]}; species c schedules: b + world;' allows to simulate a model where the agents of b are scheduled first, followed by the world, without even having to create an instance of c.
\item
  \texttt{skills} (list): The list of skills that will be made available to the instances of this species. Each new skill provides attributes and actions that will be added to the ones defined in this species
\item

\item
  \texttt{use\_regular\_agents} (boolean): (grid only),(true by default). Allows to specify if the agents of the grid are regular agents (like those of any other species) or minimal ones (which can't have sub-populations, can't inherit from a regular species, etc.)
\item
  \texttt{virtual} (boolean): whether the species is virtual (cannot be instantiated, but only used as a parent) (false by default)
\item
  \texttt{width} (int): (grid only), the width of the grid (in terms of agent number)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{definition-42}{%

### user_panel 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`name`** (an identifier), (omissible) : The name of the panel
  * `initial` (boolean): Whether or not this panel will be the initial one 
    
#### Definition

It is the basic behavior of the user control architecture (it is similar to state for the FSM architecture). This user_panel translates, in the interface, in a semi-modal view that awaits the user to choose action buttons, change attributes of the controlled agent, etc. Each user_panel, like a state in FSM, can have a enter and exit sections, but it is only defined in terms of a set of user_commands which describe the different action buttons present in the panel.

#### Usages

* The general syntax is for example:
\end{verbatim}

user\_panel default initial: true \{ user\_input `Number' returns: number type: int \textless{}- 10; ask (number among list(cells))\{ do die; \} transition to: ``Advanced Control'' when: every (10); \} user\_panel ``Advanced Control'' \{ user\_input ``Location'' returns: loc type: point \textless{}- \{0,0\}; create cells number: 10 with: {[}location::loc{]}; \} ```

\begin{verbatim}
float dist <- 0.0; using topology(grid_ant) {   d (self.location distance_to target.location); } ```
