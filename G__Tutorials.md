# Tutorials

---


We propose some tutorials that are designed to allow modelers to become progressively autonomous with the GAMA platform. These tutorials cover different aspects of GAMA (Grid environment, GIS integration, 3D, multi-level modeling, equation-based models...). It is a good idea to keep a copy of the [reference of the GAML language](G__GamlReference) around when undertaking one of these tutorials.

## [Predator Prey tutorial](Tutorial__PredatorPreyTutorial)
<a></a>
<img src='http://gama-platform.googlecode.com/files/predator_prey.png' width='200/><br' />

This tutorial introduces the basic concepts of GAMA and the use of grids. It is based on the classic predator prey model (see for instance a formal definition [here](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Agent_based_modeling)). It is particularly adapted to beginners that want to quickly learn how to build a simple model in GAMA.

## [Stupid Model](Tutorial__StupidModelTutorial)
<a></a>
This tutorial introduces the basic concepts of GAMA and the use of grids. It is based on the [stupid model specification](http://condor.depaul.edu/slytinen/abm/StupidModel/). Like the predator prey tutorial, it presents how to build a simple model and a grid supporting the movements of agents. Note that it introduces as well some interesting features related to the [scheduling of agents](G__RuntimeConcepts) and the [user interface of experiments](G__ExperimentsUserInterface).

## [Road Traffic](Tutorial__RoadTrafficTutorial)
<a></a>
<img src='http://gama-platform.googlecode.com/files/road_traffic.png' width='200/><br' />

This tutorial introduces the use of GIS data. It is based on a mobility and daily activity model. It is particularly adapted to modelers that want to quickly learn how to integrate GIS data in their model and to use a road shapefile for the movement of their agents.

## [3D Tutorial](Tutorial__ThreeDTutorial)
<a></a>
This tutorial introduces the use of 3D in GAMA. In particular, it offers a quick overview of the 3D capabilities of the platform and how to integrate 3D features in models.

## [Incremental Model](Tutorial__IncrementalTutorial)
<a></a>
<br />

<br />

This tutorial proposes a complete overview of many features of GAMA. It concerns a model of disease spreading in a small city. In particular, it presents how to integrate GIS data and use GIS, to use a road shapefile for the movement of agents, to define a 3D display, to define a multi-level model and use differential equations.
