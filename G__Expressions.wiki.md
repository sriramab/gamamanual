# Expressions

---

Expressions in GAML are the value part of the [statements](Statements161.md)' facets. They represent or compute data that will be used as the value of the facet when the statement will be executed.

An expression can be either a [literal](G__Literals.md), a [unit](G__UnitsAndConstants.md), a [constant](G__UnitsAndConstants.md), a [variable](ExpressionVariables161.md), an [attribute](G__VariablesAndAttributes.md) or the application of one or several [operators](G__OperatorsAK.md) to compose a complex expression.
