# The 'model' built-in species (Under Construction)



As described in the [presentation of GAML](G__KeyConcepts), any model in GAMA is a species (introduced by the keyword [`global`](G__GlobalSpecies)) which directly inherits from an abstract species called `model`. This abstract species (sub-species of [`agent`](G__AgentBuiltInSpecies)) defines several attributes and actions that can then be used in any global section of any model.



## `model` attributes
`model` defines several attributes, which, in addition to the attributes inherited from [`agent`](G__AgentBuiltInSpecies), form the minimal set of knowledge a model can manipulate.
