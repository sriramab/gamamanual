# Changes between 1.6.1 and 1.7 that can influence the dynamics of models

* Initialization order between the initialization of variables and the execution of the `init` block in grids
init -> vars in 1.6.1 / vars -> init in 1.7
* Initialization order of agents
put a sample model to explain the order of creation and its differences
* Initialization of vars to their default value
map ? list ? 
* Systematic casting and verification of types
give examples



# Enhancements in 1.7
* multi-simulation
* date
* font in draw
* draw of complex shapes
* viewers for common files
* editor: doc on built-in elements, templates, shortcuts to common tasks, hyperlinks to files used
* validation: improvement in time, gathering of infos/todos
* navigator: better overview of model files and their support files, addition of plugin models
* Models library: 
* Preferences:
* Simulation views
* Error view
* language: file management, new operators, new statements, new skills(?), new built-in variables,
