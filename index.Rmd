# Notice {-}

* The main purpose of this book is to provide a simple introduction with bare minimum content that helps the reader to get started with GAMA Language (GAML).

 * The content of this manual is from gama-platform.org website. I have  modified and edited portions of the content to give a cleaner format.

* This is a modified content and is not a 100% reproduction. If you do not find what you are looking for, go to the main website.

* See downloads section for a different way to obtain full GAMA documentation.

* I thank the Team of GAMA-Platform for giving me the permission to reproduce their content.
