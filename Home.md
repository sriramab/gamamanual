# <font color='blue'>Description</font>
<font face='verdana' size='2'>
<b>GAMA</b> is a simulation platform, which aims at providing field experts, modellers, and computer scientists with a complete modelling and simulation development environment for building spatially explicit multi-agent simulations. It has been developed by the research team MSI (located in the IFI, Hanoi, and part of the IRD/UPMC International Research Unit UMMISCO) since 2007.<br>
<br>
The most important requirements of spatially explicit multi-agent simulations that GAMA fulfils are:<br>
<ul><li>The ability to use complex GIS data as an environment for the agents.<br>
</li><li>The ability to handle a vast number of (possibly heterogeneous) agents.<br>
</li><li>The ability to offer a platform for automated controlled experiments (by automatically varying parameters, recording statistics, etc.).<br>
</li><li>The possibility to let non-computer scientists design models and interact with the agents during simulations.</li></ul>

Beyond these features, GAMA also offers:<br>
<ul><li>A complete modeling language, GAML, for modeling agents and environments<br>
</li><li>A large and extensible library of primitives (agent's movement, communication, mathematical functions, graphical, ...)<br>
</li><li>A cross-platform reproducibility of simulations<br>
</li><li>A powerful and flexible plotting system<br>
</li><li>An user interface based on the Eclipse platform<br>
</li><li>A complete set of batch tools, allowing for a systematic or "intelligent" exploration of models parameters spaces</li></ul>

<h1><font color='blue'>Source Code</font></h1>

The source code of GAMA is now available for downloading. You can access to it from our SVN server using the following read-only account:<br>
<br>
<code>svn checkout http://gama-platform.googlecode.com/svn/branches/current </code>

Or you can browse the Source path of the repository <a href='http://code.google.com/p/gama-platform/source/browse/'>here</a>

Please note that GAMA comes as an <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/'>Eclipse</a> project, and that it heavily relies on Eclipse features for compiling and running. If you do not have Eclipse installed, please <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/'>download</a> it ("Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in Developers" distribution recommended), and then simply create a new project using the wizard called "Projects from CVS", entering the information above when the wizard asks for the repository. Some information on the required Eclipse environment can be found on this wiki.<br>
