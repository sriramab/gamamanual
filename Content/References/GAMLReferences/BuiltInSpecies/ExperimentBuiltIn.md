# The 'experiment' built-in species (Under Construction)



As described in the [presentation of GAML](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Content\Tutorials\LearnGAMLStepByStep\Introduction.md), any experiment attached to a model is a species (introduced by the keyword `experiment` which directly or indirectly inherits from an abstract species called `experiment` itself. This abstract species (sub-species of `agent`) defines several attributes and actions that can then be used in any experiment.






## `experiment` attributes
`experiment` defines several attributes, which, in addition to the attributes inherited from [`agent`](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Content\References\GAMLReferences\BuiltInSpecies\AgentBuiltIn.md), form the minimal set of knowledge any experiment will have access to.
