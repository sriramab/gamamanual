\chapter{Java version}\label{java-version}

Due to changes in the libraries used by GAMA 1.7 and 1.8, this version
now \textbf{requires JDK/JVM 1.8} to run. Please note that GAMA
\textbf{has not been tested with JDK 1.9 and 1.10}.

\section{Changes between 1.6.1 and 1.7/1.8 that can influence the
dynamics of
models}\label{changes-between-1.6.1-and-1.71.8-that-can-influence-the-dynamics-of-models}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Initialization order between the initialization of variables and the
  execution of the \texttt{init} block in grids init -\textgreater{}
  vars in 1.6.1 / vars -\textgreater{} init in 1.7
\item
  Initialization order of agents -\textgreater{} now, the init block of
  the agents are not executed at the end of the global init, but during
  it. put a sample model to explain the order of creation and its
  differences
\item
  Initialization of vars to their default value map ? list ?
\item
  Systematic casting and verification of types give examples
\item
  header of CSV files: be careful, in GAMA 1.7, if the first line is
  detected as a header, it is not read when the file is casted as a
  matrix (so the first row of the matrix is not the header, but the
  first line of data) gives examples
\item
  the step of batch experiments is now executed after all repetitions of
  simulations are done (not after each one). They can however be still
  accessed using the attributes \texttt{simulations} (see Batch.gaml in
  Models Library)
\item
  signal and diffuse have been merged into a single statement
\item
  facets do not accept a space between their identifier and the
  \texttt{:} anymore.
\item
  simplification of equation/solve statements and deprecation of old
  facets
\item
  in FIPA skill, \texttt{content}is replaced everywhere with
  \texttt{contents}
\item
  in FIPA skill, \texttt{receivers} is replaced everywhere with
  \texttt{to}
\item
  in FIPA skill, \texttt{messages} is replaced by \texttt{mailbox}
\item
  The pseudo-attribute \texttt{user\_location} has been removed (not
  deprecated, unfortunately) and replaced by the ``unit''
  \texttt{\#user\_location}.
\item
  The actions called by an \texttt{event} layer do not need anymore to
  define \texttt{point} and \texttt{list\textless{}agent\textgreater{}}
  arguments to receive the mouse location and the list of agents
  selected. Instead, they can now use \texttt{\#user\_location} and they
  have to compute the selected agents by themselves (using an arbitrary
  function).
\item
  The random number generators now better handle seeding (larger range),
  but it can change the series of values previously obtained from a
  given seed in 1.6.1
\item
  all models now have a starting\_date and a current\_date. They then
  dont begin at an hypothetical ``zero'' date, but at the epoch date
  defined by ISO 8601 (1970/1/1). It should not change models that dont
  rely on dates, except that:
\item
  the \#year (and its nicknames \#y, \#years) and \#month (and its
  nickname \#month) do not longer have a default value (of resp. 30 days
  and 360 days). Instead, they are always evaluated against the
  current\_date of the model. If no starting\_date is defined, the
  values of \#month and \#year will then depend on the sequence of
  months and year since epoch day.
\item
  \texttt{as\_time}, \texttt{as\_system\_time}, \texttt{as\_date} and
  \texttt{as\_system\_date} have been removed
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Enhancements in 1.7/1.8}\label{enhancements-in-1.71.8}

\section{Simulations}\label{simulations}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  simulations can now be run in parallel withing an experiment (with
  their outputs, displays, etc.)
\item
  batch experiments inherit from this possibility and can now run their
  repetitions in parallel too.
\item
  concurrency between agents is now possible and can be controlled on a
  species/grid/ask basis (from multi-threaded concurrency to complete
  parallelism within a species/grid or between the targets of an
  \texttt{ask} statement)
\end{itemize}

\section{Language}\label{language}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{gama} : a new immutable agent that can be invoked to change
  preferences or access to platform-only properties (like
  \texttt{machine-time})
\item
  \texttt{abort}: a new behavior (like \texttt{reflex} or \texttt{init})
  that is executed once when the agent is about to die
\item
  \texttt{try} and \texttt{catch} statements now provide a robust way to
  catch errors happening in the simulations.
\item
  \texttt{super} (instead of \texttt{self}) and \texttt{invoke} (instead
  of \texttt{do}) can now be used to call an action defined in a parent
  species.
\item
  \texttt{date} : new data type that offers the possibility to use a
  real calendar, to define a \texttt{starting\_date} and to query a
  \texttt{current\_date} from a simulation, to parse dates from date
  files or to output them in custom formats. Dates can be added,
  subtracted, compared. Various new operators (\texttt{minus\_months},
  etc.) allow for a fine manipulation of their data. Time units
  (\texttt{\#sec}, \texttt{\#s}, \texttt{\#mn}, \texttt{\#minute},
  \texttt{\#h}, \texttt{\#hour}, \texttt{\#day}, etc.) can be used in
  conjunction with them. Interval of dates (date1 to date2) can be
  created and used as a basis for loops, etc. Various simple operators
  allow for defining conditions based on the current\_date
  (after(date1), before(date2), since(date1), etc.).
\item
  \texttt{font} type allows to define fonts more precisely in
  \texttt{draw} statements
\item
  BDI control architecture for agents
\item
  file management, new operators, new statements, new skills(?), new
  built-in variables, files can now download their contents from the web
  by using standard http: https: addresses instead of file paths.
\item
  The \texttt{save} can now directly manipulate files and \ldots{} save
  them. So something like
  \texttt{save\ shape\_file("bb.shp",\ my\_agents\ collect\ each.shape);}
  is possible. In addition, a new facet \texttt{attributes} allows to
  define complex attributes to be saved.
\item
  \texttt{assert} has a simpler syntax and can be used in any behaviour
  to raise an error if a condition is not met.
\item
  \texttt{test} is a new type of experiments
  (\texttt{experiment\ aaa\ type:\ test\ ...}), equivalent to a
  \texttt{batch} with an exhaustive search method, which automatically
  displays the status of tests found in the model.
\item
  new operators (\texttt{sum\_of}, \texttt{product\_of}, etc.)
\item
  casting of files works
\item
  co-modeling (importation of micro-models that can be managed within a
  macro-model)
\item
  populations of agents can now be easily exported to CSV files using
  the \texttt{save} statement
\item
  Simple \texttt{messaging} skill between agents\\
\item
  Terminal commands can now be issued from within GAMA using the
  \texttt{console} operator
\item
  New \texttt{status} statement allows to change the text of the status.
\item
  light statement in 3D display provides the possibility to custom your
  lights (point lights, direction lights, spot lights)
\item
  Displays can now inherit from other displays (facets \texttt{parent}
  and \texttt{virtual} to describe abstract displays)
\item
  \texttt{on\_change:} facet for attributes/parameters allows to define
  a sequence of statements to run whenever the value changes.
\item
  \texttt{species} and \texttt{experiment} now support the
  \texttt{virtual} boolean facet (virtual species can not be
  instantiated, and virtual experiments do not show up).
\item
  \texttt{experiment} now supports the \texttt{auto\_run} boolean facet
  (to run automatically when launched)
\end{itemize}

\section{Definition}\label{definition}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions.
An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are
other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and
returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below),
with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical
(\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair
(\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special
infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators
(\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does
not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex
expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for
constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps)
will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}}
or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules
apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the
functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1)}) * if they have two arguments, either
the functional prefixed syntax (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used. * if
they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a
special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of
the operator name (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be
used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not
have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the
\texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in
a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled
list.

\section{\texorpdfstring{}{ }}\label{section}

\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions
composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to
arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: *
the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of
operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a
pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are
evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly,
\texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return
a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator,
the functional if-else (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the
result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, \texttt{and}
and \texttt{or} (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the
value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e.
\texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=},
\texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=}) * next the arithmetic
operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher
priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators \texttt{-}
and \texttt{!} * next the access operators \texttt{.} and
\texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the
result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two
points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest
priority of all.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are
called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional
operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as
the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the
action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted).
For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly
acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is
\texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a
value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of
type \texttt{unknown} (e.g.
\texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the
general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might
perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result}

If it is used as an unary operator, it returns the opposite of the
operand. Returns the difference of the two operands.

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment}

The behavior of the operator depends on the type of the operands.

\subsubsection{Special cases:}\label{special-cases}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if both operands are containers and the right operand is empty, -
  returns the left operand\\
\item
  if the left operand is a species and the right operand is an agent of
  the species, - returns a list containing all the agents of the species
  minus this agent\\
\item
  if both operands are numbers, performs a normal arithmetic difference
  and returns a float if one of them is a float.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
int var10 <- 1 - 1; // var10 equals 0
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if both operands are containers, returns a new list in which all the
  elements of the right operand have been removed from the left one
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
list<int> var11 <- [1,2,3,4,5,6] - [2,4,9]; // var11 equals [1,3,5,6] 
list<int> var12 <- [1,2,3,4,5,6] - [0,8]; // var12 equals [1,2,3,4,5,6]
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if one of the operands is a date and the other a number, returns a
  date corresponding to the date minus the given number as duration (in
  seconds)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
date var13 <- date('2000-01-01') - 86400; // var13 equals date('1999-12-31')
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if both operands are points, returns their difference (coordinates per
  coordinates).
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
point var14 <- {1, 2} - {4, 5}; // var14 equals {-3.0, -3.0}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if both operands are a point, a geometry or an agent, returns the
  geometry resulting from the difference between both geometries
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
geometry var15 <- geom1 - geom2; // var15 equals a geometry corresponding to difference between geom1 and geom2
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if one operand is a color and the other an integer, returns a new
  color resulting from the subtraction of each component of the color
  with the right operand
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
rgb var16 <- rgb([255, 128, 32]) - 3; // var16 equals rgb([252,125,29])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if the left-hand operand is a geometry and the right-hand operand a
  float, returns a geometry corresponding to the left-hand operand
  (geometry, agent, point) reduced by the right-hand operand distance
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
geometry var17 <- shape - 5; // var17 equals a geometry corresponding to the geometry of the agent applying the operator reduced by a distance of 5
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if the left operand is a list and the right operand is an object of
  any type (except list), - returns a list containing the elements of
  the left operand minus all the occurrences of this object
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
list<int> var18 <- [1,2,3,4,5,6] - 2; // var18 equals [1,3,4,5,6] 
list<int> var19 <- [1,2,3,4,5,6] - 0; // var19 equals [1,2,3,4,5,6]
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if both operands are dates, returns the duration in seconds between
  date2 and date1. To obtain a more precise duration, in milliseconds,
  use milliseconds\_between(date1, date2)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
float var20 <- date('2000-01-02') - date('2000-01-01'); // var20 equals 86400
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if both operands are colors, returns a new color resulting from the
  subtraction of the two operands, component by component
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
rgb var21 <- rgb([255, 128, 32]) - rgb('red'); // var21 equals rgb([0,128,32])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if left-hand operand is a point and the right-hand a number, returns a
  new point with each coordinate as the difference of the operand
  coordinate with this number.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
point var22 <- {1, 2} - 4.5; // var22 equals {-3.5, -2.5, -4.5} 
point var23 <- {1, 2} - 4; // var23 equals {-3.0,-2.0,-4.0}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if the right-operand is a list of points, geometries or agents,
  returns the geometry resulting from the difference between the
  left-geometry and all of the right-geometries
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
geometry var24 <- rectangle(10,10) - [circle(2), square(2)]; // var24 equals rectangle(10,10) - (circle(2) + square(2))
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if one operand is a matrix and the other a number (float or int),
  performs a normal arithmetic difference of the number with each
  element of the matrix (results are float if the number is a float.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
matrix var25 <- 3.5 - matrix([[2,5],[3,4]]); // var25 equals matrix([[1.5,-1.5],[0.5,-0.5]])

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-16}

returns a new flat list, in which each element is the evaluation of the
right-hand operand. If this evaluation returns a list, the elements of
this result are added directly to the list returned

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-2}

accumulate is dedicated to the application of a same computation on each
element of a container (and returns a list). In the right-hand operand,
the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the
left-hand operand elements.

\subsubsection{Examples:}\label{examples-13}

\begin{verbatim}
 
list var0 <- [a1,a2,a3] accumulate (each neighbors_at 10); // var0 equals a flat list of all the neighbors of these three agents 
list<int> var1 <- [1,2,4] accumulate ([2,4]); // var1 equals [2,4,2,4,2,4]

\section{Definition}\label{definition-1}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions.
An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are
other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and
returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below),
with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical
(\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair
(\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special
infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators
(\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does
not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex
expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for
constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps)
will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}}
or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules
apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the
functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1)}) * if they have two arguments, either
the functional prefixed syntax (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used. * if
they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a
special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of
the operator name (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be
used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not
have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the
\texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in
a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled
list.

\section{\texorpdfstring{}{ }}\label{section-19}

\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators-1}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions
composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to
arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: *
the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of
operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a
pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are
evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly,
\texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return
a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator,
the functional if-else (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the
result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, \texttt{and}
and \texttt{or} (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the
value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e.
\texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=},
\texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=}) * next the arithmetic
operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher
priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators \texttt{-}
and \texttt{!} * next the access operators \texttt{.} and
\texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the
result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two
points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest
priority of all.

\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators-1}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are
called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional
operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as
the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the
action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted).
For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly
acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is
\texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a
value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of
type \texttt{unknown} (e.g.
\texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the
general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might
perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

\section{Definition}\label{definition-2}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions.
An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are
other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and
returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below),
with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical
(\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair
(\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special
infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators
(\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does
not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex
expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for
constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps)
will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}}
or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules
apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the
functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1)}) * if they have two arguments, either
the functional prefixed syntax (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used. * if
they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a
special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of
the operator name (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be
used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not
have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the
\texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in
a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled
list.

\section{\texorpdfstring{}{ }}\label{section-20}

\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators-2}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions
composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to
arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: *
the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of
operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a
pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are
evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly,
\texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return
a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator,
the functional if-else (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the
result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, \texttt{and}
and \texttt{or} (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the
value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e.
\texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=},
\texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=}) * next the arithmetic
operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher
priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators \texttt{-}
and \texttt{!} * next the access operators \texttt{.} and
\texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the
result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two
points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest
priority of all.

\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators-2}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are
called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional
operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as
the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the
action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted).
For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly
acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is
\texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a
value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of
type \texttt{unknown} (e.g.
\texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the
general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might
perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

converts a string to a date following a custom pattern and a specific
locale (e.g. `fr', `en'\ldots{}). The pattern can use ``\%Y \%M \%N \%D
\%E \%h \%m \%s \%z'' for parsing years, months, name of month, days,
name of days, hours, minutes, seconds and the time-zone. A null or empty
pattern will parse the date using one of the ISO date \& time formats
(similar to date(`\ldots{}') in that case). The pattern can also follow
the pattern definition found here, which gives much more control over
what will be parsed:
\url{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html\#patterns}.
Different patterns are available by default as constant: \#iso\_local,

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-143}

The index of the best candidate according to a method based on the
ELECTRE methods. The principle of the ELECTRE methods is to compare the
possible candidates by pair. These methods analyses the possible
outranking relation existing between two candidates. An candidate
outranks another if this one is at least as good as the other one. The
ELECTRE methods are based on two concepts: the concordance and the
discordance. The concordance characterizes the fact that, for an
outranking relation to be validated, a sufficient majority of criteria
should be in favor of this assertion. The discordance characterizes the
fact that, for an outranking relation to be validated, none of the
criteria in the minority should oppose too strongly this assertion.
These two conditions must be true for validating the outranking
assertion. More information about the ELECTRE methods can be found in
{[}\url{http://www.springerlink.com/content/g367r44322876223/} Figueira,
J., Mousseau, V., Roy, B.: ELECTRE Methods. In: Figueira, J., Greco, S.,
and Ehrgott, M., (Eds.), Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of
the Art Surveys, Springer, New York, 133--162 (2005){]}. The first
operand is the list of candidates (a candidate is a list of criterion
values); the second operand the list of criterion: A criterion is a map
that contains fives elements: a name, a weight, a preference value (p),
an indifference value (q) and a veto value (v). The preference value
represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion
values allows to prefer one vector of values over another. The
indifference value represents the threshold from which the difference
between two criterion values is considered significant. The veto value
represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion
values disqualifies the candidate that obtained the smaller value; the
last operand is the fuzzy cut.

the value of the every operator depends on the cycle. It can be used to
do something every x cycle.Used to do something at regular intervals of
time. Can be used in conjunction with `since', `after', `before',
`until' or `between', so that this computation only takes place in the

Dempster A (1967) Upper and lower probabilities induced by multivalued
mapping. Annals of Mathematical Statistics, vol. 38, pp.~325--339{]}) on
lower and upper probability distributions. The first operand is the list
of candidates (a candidate is a list of criterion values); the second
operand the list of criterion: A criterion is a map that contains seven
elements: a name, a first threshold s1, a second threshold s2, a value
for the assertion ``this candidate is the best'' at threshold s1 (v1p),
a value for the assertion ``this candidate is the best'' at threshold s2
(v2p), a value for the assertion ``this candidate is not the best'' at
threshold s1 (v1c), a value for the assertion ``this candidate is not
the best'' at threshold s2 (v2c). v1p, v2p, v1c and v2c have to been
defined in order that: v1p + v1c \textless{}= 1.0; v2p + v2c

Creates a file in read/write mode, setting its contents to the container
passed in parameter opens a file in read only mode, creates a GAML file
object, and tries to determine and store the file content in the
contents attribute.

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-36}

The type of container to pass will depend on the type of file (see the
management of files in the documentation). Can be used to copy files
since files are considered as containers. For example: save
file(`image\_copy.png', file(`image.png')); will copy image.png to
image\_copy.pngThe file should have a supported extension, see file type
definition for supported file extensions.

\section{Definition}\label{definition-3}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions.
An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are
other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and
returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below),
with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical
(\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair
(\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special
infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators
(\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does
not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex
expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for
constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps)
will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}}
or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules
apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the
functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1)}) * if they have two arguments, either
the functional prefixed syntax (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used. * if
they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a
special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of
the operator name (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be
used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not
have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the
\texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in
a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled
list.

\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators-3}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions
composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to
arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: *
the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of
operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a
pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are
evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly,
\texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return
a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator,
the functional if-else (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the
result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, \texttt{and}
and \texttt{or} (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the
value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e.
\texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=},
\texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=}) * next the arithmetic
operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher
priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators \texttt{-}
and \texttt{!} * next the access operators \texttt{.} and
\texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the
result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two
points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest
priority of all.

\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators-3}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are
called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional
operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as
the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the
action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted).
For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly
acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is
\texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a
value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of
type \texttt{unknown} (e.g.
\texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the
general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might
perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-253}

Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) is a type of deterministic method for
multivariate interpolation with a known scattered set of points. The
assigned values to each geometry are calculated with a weighted average
of the values available at the known points. See:
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting} Usage: IDW
(list of geometries, map of points (key: point, value: value), power
parameter)

\section{Definition}\label{definition-4}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions.
An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are
other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and
returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below),
with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical
(\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair
(\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special
infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators
(\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does
not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex
expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for
constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps)
will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}}
or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules
apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the
functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1)}) * if they have two arguments, either
the functional prefixed syntax (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used. * if
they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a
special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of
the operator name (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be
used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not
have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the
\texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in
a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled
list.

\section{\texorpdfstring{}{ }}\label{section-22}

\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators-4}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions
composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to
arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: *
the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of
operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a
pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are
evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly,
\texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return
a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator,
the functional if-else (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the
result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, \texttt{and}
and \texttt{or} (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the
value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e.
\texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=},
\texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=}) * next the arithmetic
operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher
priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators \texttt{-}
and \texttt{!} * next the access operators \texttt{.} and
\texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the
result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two
points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest
priority of all.

\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators-4}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are
called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional
operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as
the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the
action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted).
For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly
acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is
\texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a
value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of
type \texttt{unknown} (e.g.
\texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the
general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might
perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-368}

a list, containing the agents of the left-hand operand whose species is
the one denoted by the right-hand operand.The expression agents
of\_species (species self) is equivalent to agents where (species each =
species self); however, the advantage of using the first syntax is that
the resulting list is correctly typed with the right species, whereas,
in the second syntax, the parser cannot determine the species of the
agents within the list (resulting in the need to cast it explicitly if
it is to be used in an ask statement, for instance).

\section{Definition}\label{definition-5}

Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions.
An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are
other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and
returns the result of this function.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ operand3)}, see below),
with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. \texttt{+}, \texttt{/}), logical
(\texttt{and}, \texttt{or}), comparison (e.g. \texttt{\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}}), access (\texttt{.}, \texttt{{[}..{]}}) and pair
(\texttt{::}) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_symbol\ operand1}).

The ternary functional if-else operator, \texttt{?\ :}, uses a special
infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ ?\ operand2\ :\ operand3}). Two unary operators
(\texttt{-} and \texttt{!}) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does
not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex
expression (e.g. \texttt{-\ 10}, \texttt{!\ (operand1\ or\ operand2)}).

Finally, special constructor operators (\texttt{\{...\}} for
constructing points, \texttt{{[}...{]}} for constructing lists and maps)
will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}}, \texttt{{[}operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operandn{]}}
or \texttt{{[}key1::value1,\ key2::value2...\ keyn::valuen{]}}).

With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules
apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the
functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1)}) * if they have two arguments, either
the functional prefixed syntax (e.g.
\texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2)}) or the infixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operand1\ operator\_name\ operand2}) can be used. * if
they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax
(e.g. \texttt{operator\_name(operand1,\ operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) or a
special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of
the operator name (e.g.
\texttt{operand1\ operator\_name(operand2,\ ...,\ operand)}) can be
used.

All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.

Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e.~they are guaranteed to not
have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the
\texttt{shuffle} operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in
a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled
list.

\section{\texorpdfstring{}{ }}\label{section-23}

\section{Priority between operators}\label{priority-between-operators-5}

The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions
composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.

GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to
arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: *
the constructor operators, like \texttt{::}, used to compose pairs of
operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ::\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return a
pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are
evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly,
\texttt{{[}a\ \textgreater{}\ 10,\ b\ \textgreater{}\ 5{]}} will return
a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the \texttt{?:} operator,
the functional if-else (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ ?\ a\ +\ 10\ :\ a\ -\ 10} will return the
result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, \texttt{and}
and \texttt{or} (e.g.
\texttt{a\ \textgreater{}\ b\ or\ b\ \textgreater{}\ c} will return the
value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e.
\texttt{\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}}, \texttt{\textless{}=},
\texttt{\textgreater{}=}, \texttt{=}, \texttt{!=}) * next the arithmetic
operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher
priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators \texttt{-}
and \texttt{!} * next the access operators \texttt{.} and
\texttt{{[}{]}} (e.g.
\texttt{\{1,2,3\}.x\ \textgreater{}\ 20\ +\ \{4,5,6\}.y} will return the
result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two
points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest
priority of all.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\section{Using actions as operators}\label{using-actions-as-operators-5}

Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are
called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional
operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as
the first operand.

For instance, if the following species is defined:

\begin{verbatim}
species spec1 {
        int min(int x, int y) {
                return x > y ? x : y;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

Any agent instance of spec1 can use \texttt{min} as an operator (if the
action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted).
For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly
acceptable:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
        init {
                create spec1;
                spec1 my_agent <- spec1[0];
                int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

If the action doesn't have any operands, the syntax to use is
\texttt{my\_agent\ the\_action()}. Finally, if it does not return a
value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of
type \texttt{unknown} (e.g.
\texttt{unknown\ result\ \textless{}-\ my\_agent\ the\_action(op1,\ op2);}).

Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the
general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might
perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

asks the user for some values (not defined as parameters). Takes a
string (optional) and a map as arguments. The string is used to specify
the message of the dialog box. The map is to specify the parameters you
want the user to change before the simulation starts, with the name of
the parameter in string key, and the default value as value.

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-104}

This operator takes a map {[}string::value{]} as argument, displays a
dialog asking the user for these values, and returns the same map with
the modified values (if any). The dialog is modal and will interrupt the
execution of the simulation until the user has either dismissed or
accepted it. It can be used, for instance, in an init section to force
the user to input new values instead of relying on the initial values of
parameters :

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-532}

returns the weight of the given edge (right-hand operand) contained in
the graph given in right-hand operand.

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-107}

In a localized graph, an edge has a weight by default (the distance
between both vertices).

\subsubsection{Special cases:}\label{special-cases-144}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if the left-operand (the graph) is nil, returns nil\\
\item
  if the right-hand operand is not an edge of the given graph,
  weight\_of checks whether it is a node of the graph and tries to
  return its weight\\
\item
  if the right-hand operand is neither a node, nor an edge, returns 1.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Examples:}\label{examples-380}

\begin{verbatim}
graph graphFromMap <-  as_edge_graph([{1,5}::{12,45},{12,45}::{34,56}]);  
float var1 <- graphFromMap weight_of(link({1,5},{12,45})); // var1 equals 1.0
