<p><strong><em>7-11 December 2015 - Siem Reap (Cambodia)</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="../../github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/Community/resources/other/trainingSession/SiemReap2015/photos/group.JPG.jpg" alt="resources/other/trainingSession/SiemReap2015/photos/group.JPG"></p>
<p>This training session took place at the Apsara Authorities, where we introduced how to build a model with agent-based approach, using GAMA. In a new and very fast growing city such as Siem Reap, some measures have to be taken to anticipate the future of the city, and modeling is a science that can give some solutions to face those problems.</p>
<p>The training session was divided into 2 parts :</p>
<ul>
<li>A theoretical part (3 days) dealing with the following subjects :
<ul>
<li>Urban issues and introduction to Agent-Based Modeling</li>
<li>Presentation of the modeling methodology</li>
<li>Introduction to GAMA with a model on urban segregation</li>
<li>GIS datas and graphs to model urban mobility</li>
<li>GIS, Raster datas and graphs to model urban growth</li>
<li>Use of experiments to calibrate and explore models</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A practical part (2 days) to build a model about urban mobility in Siem Reap (by groups of 4/5 people)</li>
</ul>

<p>The JTD (<a href="http://www.tamdaoconf.com/">Journées de Tam Dao</a>) is an annual gathering of french-talkers researchers during the summer for one week, dealing with a specific subject related to sustainable development. For this 8th JTD, the topic was about sustainable urban development, and a workshop has been made especially about how to use tools as GAMA to build models in order to explore and understand urban spatial dynamics.</p>
<p>Trainers : Drogoul Alexis, Banos Arnaud, Huỳnh Quang Nghi, Trương Chí Quang, Võ Đức Ân.</p>
