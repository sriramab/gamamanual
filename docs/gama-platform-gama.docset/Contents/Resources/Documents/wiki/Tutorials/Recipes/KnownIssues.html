<p>If you are using GAMA with Windows, and your video card is a Radeon AMD, then GAMA can crash while running a simulation using OpenGL. To avoid this issue, you have to disable your video card. This will slow down a bit the performances, but at least you will be able to run GAMA without those annoying crashes.</p>
<p>To disable your video card, open the control panel, click on Hardware and Sound / Devices and Printers / Device manager, and then right click on your video card (as shown in the following image)</p>

<p>When you try to display a grid with opengl, the cells have not a regular shape (as it is shown in the following image)</p>
<p><img src="../../../github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/Tutorials/Recipes/resources/images/recipes/grid_display_problem.png" alt="resources/images/recipes/grid_display_problem.png"></p>
<p>The reason of this problem is that we can only map a grid of 2^n*2^n cells in the plan. Here are some solutions for this problem :</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a grid with 2^n*2^n dimension (such as 16x16, or 32x32)</li>
<li>Display the grid in java2D</li>
<li>Display the grid as <em>species</em>, and not as <em>grid</em> (note that the difference in term of performance between displaying a grid as a <em>grid</em> and as a <em>species</em> is not so important for opengl displays. It has originally been done for java2D displays)</li>
</ul>
