<p>GAML is an <em>agent-oriented</em> language dedicated to the definition of <em>agent-based</em> simulations. It takes its roots in <em>object-oriented</em> languages like Java or Smalltalk, but extends the object-oriented programming approach with powerful concepts (like skills, declarative definitions or agent migration) to allow for a better expressivity in models.</p>
<p>It is of course very close to <em>agent_based</em> modeling languages like, e.g., <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a>, but, in addition to enriching the traditional representation of agents with modern computing notions like inheritance, type safety or multi-level agency, and providing the possibility to use different behavioral architectures for programming agents, GAML extends the agent-based paradigm to eliminate the boundaries between the domain of a model (which, in ABM, is represented with agents) and the experimental processes surrounding its simulations (which are usually not represented with agents), including, for example, <em>visualization</em> processes. This <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.7241&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a> (<em>Drogoul A., Vanbergue D., Meurisse T., Multi-Agent Based Simulation: Where are the Agents ?, Multi-Agent Based Simulation 3, pp. 1-15, LNCS, Springer-Verlag. 2003</em>) was in particular foundational in the definition of the concepts on which GAMA (and GAML) are based today.</p>
<p>This orientation has several conceptual consequences among which at least two are of immediate practical interest for modelers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since simulations, or experiments, are represented by agents, GAMA is bound to support high-level <em>model compositionality</em>, i.e. the definition of models that can use other models as <em>inner agents</em>, leveraging multi-modeling or multi-paradigm modeling as particular cases of composition.</li>
<li>The <em>visualization</em> of models can be expressed by <em>models of visualization</em>, composed of agents entirely dedicated to visually represent other agents, allowing for a clear <em>separation of concerns</em> between a simulation and its representation and, hence, the possibility to play with multiple representations of the same model at once.</li>

<p>The vocabulary of GAML is described in the following sentences, in which the meaning and relationships of the important <em>words</em> of the language (in <strong>bold face</strong>) are summarized.</p>
<ol>
<li>The role of GAML is to support modelers in writing <strong>models</strong>, which are specifications of <strong>simulations</strong> that can be executed and controlled during <strong>experiments</strong>, themselves specified by <strong>experiment plans</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>agent-oriented</strong> modeling paradigm means that everything "active" (entities of a model, systems, processes, activities, like simulations and experiments) can be represented in GAML as an <strong>agent</strong> (which can be thought of as a computational component owning its own data and executing its own behavior, alone or in interaction with other agents).</li>
<li>Like in the object-oriented paradigm, where the notion of <em>class</em> is used to supply a specification for <em>objects</em>, agents in GAML are specified by their <strong>species</strong>, which provide them with a set of <strong>attributes</strong> (<em>what they know</em>), <strong>actions</strong> (<em>what they can do</em>), <strong>behaviors</strong> (<em>what they actually do</em>) and also specifies properties of their <strong>population</strong>, for instance its <strong>topology</strong> (<em>how they are connected</em>) or <strong>schedule</strong> (<em>in which order and when they should execute</em>).</li>
<li>Any <strong>species</strong> can be nested in another <strong>species</strong> (called its <em>macro-species</em>), in which case the <strong>populations</strong> of its instances will imperatively be hosted by an instance of this <em>macro-species</em>. A <strong>species</strong> can also inherit its properties from another <strong>species</strong> (called its <em>parent species</em>), creating a relationship similar to <em>specialization</em> in object-oriented design. In addition to this, <strong>species</strong> can be constructed in a compositional way with the notion of <strong>skills</strong>, bundles of <strong>attributes</strong> and <strong>actions</strong> that can be shared between different species and inherited by their children.</li>
<li>Given that all <strong>agents</strong> are specified by a <strong>species</strong>, <strong>simulations</strong> and <strong>experiments</strong> are then instances of two species which are, respectively, called <strong>model</strong> and <strong>experiment plan</strong>. Think of them as "specialized" categories of species.</li>
<li>The relationships between <strong>species</strong>, <strong>models</strong> and <strong>experiment plans</strong> are codified in the meta-model of GAML in the form of a framework composed of three abstract species respectively called <strong>agent</strong> (direct or indirect parent of all <strong>species</strong>), <strong>model</strong> (parent of all <strong>species</strong> that define a model) and <strong>experiment</strong> (parent of all <strong>species</strong> that define an experiment plan). In this meta-model, instances of the children of <strong>agent</strong> know the instance of the child of <strong>model</strong> in which they are hosted as their <strong>world</strong>, while the instance of <strong>experiment plan</strong> identifies the same agent as one of the <strong>simulations</strong> it is in charge of. The following diagram summarizes this framework:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../../github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/Tutorials/LearnGAMLStepByStep/resources/images/introduction/framework.png" alt="framework.png"></p>
<p>Putting this all together, writing a model in GAML then consists in defining a species which inherits from <strong>model</strong>, in which other <strong>species</strong>, inheriting (directly or not) from <strong>agent</strong> and representing the entities that populate this model, will be nested, and which is itself nested in one or several <strong>experiment plans</strong> among which a user will be able to choose which <strong>experiment</strong> he/she wants to execute.</p>

<p>At the operational level, i.e. when <em>running</em> an experiment in GAMA,</p>

<p>The concepts presented above are expressed in GAML using a syntax which bears resemblances with mainstream programming languages like Java, while reusing some structures from Smalltalk (namely, the syntax of <em>facets</em> or the infix notation of <em>operators</em>). While this syntax is fully described in the subsequent sections of the documentation, we summarize here the meaning of its most prominent structures and their correspondance (when it exists) with the ones used in Java and NetLogo.</p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>model</strong> is composed of a <strong>header</strong>, in which it can refer to other <strong>models</strong>, and a sequence of <strong>species</strong> and <strong>experiments</strong> declarations, in the form of special <strong>declarative statements</strong> of the language.</li>
<li>A <strong>statement</strong> can be either a <strong>declaration</strong> or a <strong>command</strong>. It is always composed of a <strong>keyword</strong> followed by an optional <strong>expression</strong>, followed by a sequence of <strong>facets</strong>, each of them composed of a <strong>keyword</strong> (terminated by a ‘:’) and an <strong>expression</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>facets</strong> allow to pass arguments to <strong>statements</strong>. Their <strong>value</strong> is an <strong>expression</strong> of a given <strong>type</strong>. An <strong>expression</strong> can be a literary constant, the name of an <strong>attribute</strong>, <strong>variable</strong> or <strong>pseudo-variable</strong>, the name of a <strong>unit</strong> or <strong>constant</strong> of the language, or the application of an <strong>operator</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>type</strong> can be a <strong>primitive type</strong>, a <strong>species type</strong> or a <strong>parametric type</strong> (i.e. a composition of <strong>types</strong>).</li>
<li>Some <strong>statements</strong> can include sub-statements in a <strong>block</strong> (sequence of <strong>statements</strong> enclosed in curly brackets).</li>
<li><strong>declarative statements</strong> support the definition of special constructs of the language: for instance, <strong>species</strong> (including <strong>global</strong> and <strong>experiment</strong> species), <strong>attributes</strong>, <strong>actions</strong>, <strong>behaviors</strong>, <strong>aspects</strong>, <strong>variables</strong>, <strong>parameters</strong> and <strong>outputs</strong> of <strong>experiments</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>imperative statements</strong> that execute something or control the flow of execution of <strong>actions</strong>, <strong>behaviors</strong> and <strong>aspects</strong> are called <strong>commands</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>species</strong> declaration (<strong>global</strong>, <strong>species</strong> or <strong>grid</strong> keywords) can only include 6 types of declarative statements : <strong>attributes</strong>, <strong>actions</strong>, <strong>behaviors</strong>, <strong>aspects</strong>, <strong>equations</strong> and (nested) <strong>species</strong>. In addition, <strong>experiment</strong> species allow to declare <strong>parameters</strong>, <strong>outputs</strong> and batch <strong>methods</strong>.</li>
