<p>We just learnt how to launch GUI Experiments from GAMA. A GUI Experiment will start with a particular set of input, compute several outputs, and will stop at the end (if asked).</p>
<p>In order to explore models (by automatically running the Experiment using several configurations to analyze the outputs), a first approach is to run several simulations from the same experiment, considering each simulation as an agent. A second approach, much more efficient for larger explorations, is to run an other type of experiment : the <strong>Batch Experiment</strong>.</p>
<p>We will start this part by learning how to <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/Tutorials/LearnGAMLStepByStep/RunSeveralSimulations.html"><strong>run several simulations</strong></a> from the same experiment. Then, we will see how <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/Tutorials/LearnGAMLStepByStep/BatchExperiments.html"><strong>batch experiments</strong></a> work, and we will focus on how to use those batch experiments to explore models by using <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/Tutorials/LearnGAMLStepByStep/ExplorationMethods.html"><strong>exploration methods</strong></a>.</p>
