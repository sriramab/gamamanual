<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Java%20version"></a><h1 id="java-version">Java version</h1>
<p>Due to changes in the libraries used by GAMA 1.7 and 1.8, this version now <strong>requires JDK/JVM 1.8</strong> to run. Please note that GAMA <strong>has not been tested with JDK 1.9 and 1.10</strong>.</p>
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Changes%20between%201.6.1%20and%201.7%2F1.8%20that%20can%20influence%20the%20dynamics%20of%20models"></a><h2 id="changes-between-161-and-1718-that-can-influence-the-dynamics-of-models">Changes between 1.6.1 and 1.7/1.8 that can influence the dynamics of models</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initialization order between the initialization of variables and the execution of the <code>init</code> block in grids
init -&gt; vars in 1.6.1 / vars -&gt; init in 1.7</li>
<li>Initialization order of agents -&gt; now, the init block of the agents are not executed at the end of the global init, but during it.
put a sample model to explain the order of creation and its differences</li>
<li>Initialization of vars to their default value
map ? list ? </li>
<li>Systematic casting and verification of types
give examples</li>
<li>header of CSV files: be careful, in GAMA 1.7, if the first line is detected as a header, it is not read when the file is casted as a matrix (so the first row of the matrix is not the header, but the first line of data)
gives examples</li>
<li>the step of batch experiments is now executed after all repetitions of simulations are done (not after each one). They can however be still accessed using the attributes <code>simulations</code> (see Batch.gaml in Models Library)</li>
<li>signal and diffuse have been merged into a single statement</li>
<li>facets do not accept a space between their identifier and the <code>:</code> anymore.</li>
<li>simplification of equation/solve statements and deprecation of old facets</li>
<li>in FIPA skill, <code>content</code>is replaced everywhere with <code>contents</code></li>
<li>in FIPA skill, <code>receivers</code> is replaced everywhere with <code>to</code></li>
<li>in FIPA skill, <code>messages</code> is replaced by <code>mailbox</code></li>
<li>The pseudo-attribute <code>user_location</code> has been removed (not deprecated, unfortunately) and replaced by the "unit" <code>#user_location</code>.</li>
<li>The actions called by an <code>event</code> layer do not need anymore to define <code>point</code> and <code>list&lt;agent&gt;</code> arguments to receive the mouse location and the list of agents selected. Instead, they can now use <code>#user_location</code> and they have to compute the selected agents by themselves (using an arbitrary function).</li>
<li>The random number generators now better handle seeding (larger range), but it can change the series of values previously obtained from a given seed in 1.6.1</li>
<li>all models now have a starting_date and a current_date. They then dont begin at an hypothetical "zero" date, but at the epoch date defined by ISO 8601 (1970/1/1). It should not change models that dont rely on dates, except that:</li>
<li>the #year (and its nicknames #y, #years) and #month (and its nickname #month) do not longer have a default value (of resp. 30 days and 360 days). Instead, they are always evaluated against the current_date of the model. If no starting_date is defined, the values of #month and #year will then depend on the sequence of months and year since epoch day.</li>
<li><code>as_time</code>, <code>as_system_time</code>, <code>as_date</code> and <code>as_system_date</code> have been removed</li>
</ul>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Simulations"></a><h2 id="simulations">Simulations</h2>
<ul>
<li>simulations can now be run in parallel withing an experiment (with their outputs, displays, etc.)</li>
<li>batch experiments inherit from this possibility and can now run their repetitions in parallel too.</li>
<li>concurrency between agents is now possible and can be controlled on a species/grid/ask basis (from multi-threaded concurrency to complete parallelism within a species/grid or between the targets of an <code>ask</code> statement)</li>
</ul>
<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Language"></a><h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>gama</code> : a new immutable agent that can be invoked to change preferences or access to platform-only properties (like <code>machine-time</code>)</li>
<li><code>abort</code>: a new behavior (like <code>reflex</code> or <code>init</code>) that is executed once when the agent is about to die</li>
<li><code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> statements now provide a robust way to catch errors happening in the simulations. </li>
<li><code>super</code> (instead of <code>self</code>) and <code>invoke</code> (instead of <code>do</code>) can now be used to call an action defined in a parent species. </li>
<li><code>date</code> : new data type that offers the possibility to use a real calendar, to define a <code>starting_date</code> and to query a <code>current_date</code> from a simulation, to parse dates from date files or to output them in custom formats. Dates can be added, subtracted, compared. Various new operators (<code>minus_months</code>, etc.) allow for a fine manipulation of their data. Time units (<code>#sec</code>, <code>#s</code>, <code>#mn</code>, <code>#minute</code>, <code>#h</code>, <code>#hour</code>, <code>#day</code>, etc.) can be used in conjunction with them. Interval of dates (date1 to date2) can be created and used as a basis for loops, etc. Various simple operators allow for defining conditions based on the current_date (after(date1), before(date2), since(date1), etc.).</li>
<li><code>font</code> type allows to define fonts more precisely in <code>draw</code> statements</li>
<li>BDI control architecture for agents</li>
<li>file management, new operators, new statements, new skills(?), new built-in variables, files can now download their contents from the web by using standard http: https: addresses instead of file paths.</li>
<li>The <code>save</code> can now directly manipulate files and ... save them. So something like <code>save shape_file("bb.shp", my_agents collect each.shape);</code> is possible. In addition, a new facet <code>attributes</code> allows to define complex attributes to be saved. </li>
<li><code>assert</code> has a simpler syntax and can be used in any behaviour to raise an error if a condition is not met. </li>
<li><code>test</code> is a new type of experiments (<code>experiment aaa type: test ...</code>), equivalent to a <code>batch</code> with an exhaustive search method, which automatically displays the status of tests found in the model. </li>
<li>new operators (<code>sum_of</code>, <code>product_of</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>casting of files works</li>
<li>co-modeling (importation of micro-models that can be managed within a macro-model)</li>
<li>populations of agents can now be easily exported to CSV files using the <code>save</code> statement </li>
<li>Simple <code>messaging</code> skill between agents  </li>
<li>Terminal commands can now be issued from within GAMA using the <code>console</code> operator</li>
<li>New <code>status</code> statement allows to change the text of the status.</li>
<li>light statement in 3D display provides the possibility to custom your lights (point lights, direction lights, spot lights)</li>
<li>Displays can now inherit from other displays (facets <code>parent</code> and <code>virtual</code> to describe abstract displays)</li>
<li><code>on_change:</code> facet for attributes/parameters allows to define a sequence of statements to run whenever the value changes. </li>
<li><code>species</code> and <code>experiment</code> now support the <code>virtual</code> boolean facet (virtual species can not be instantiated, and virtual experiments do not show up).</li>
<li><code>experiment</code> now supports the <code>auto_run</code> boolean facet (to run automatically when launched)</li>
<li><code>experiment</code> now supports the <code>benchmark</code> boolean facet (to produce a CSV summary of the time spent in the different statements / operators of GAMA)</li>
<li>experiments can now have their own file (<code>xxx.experiment</code>) and specify the model they are targeting by providing the path to the model in the new <code>model:</code> facet (similar to <code>import</code>). </li>
<li>experiments can sport a new type: <code>test</code>, a specialised type of batch experiment that can be run automatically from the GUI or in headless and reports back the result of the tests found in its model</li>
