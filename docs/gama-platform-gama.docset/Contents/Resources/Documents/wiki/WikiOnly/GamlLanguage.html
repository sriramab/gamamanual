<table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Models that users want to simulate in GAMA have to be written in a special language, called <strong>GAML</strong> (short for <strong>GA</strong>ma <strong>M</strong>odeling <strong>L</strong>anguage)</p>
<p>GAML is born from the necessity to have a high-level declarative way of defining and reusing structures found in almost all agent-based models. See <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/WikiOnly/Introduction.html">here</a> for more information about its background.</p>
<p>Although this choice requires users to learn a new programming (or better, <em>modeling</em>) language, everything has been made in GAMA to support a short learning curve, so that they can become almost autonomous in a limited time (informal measures taken at the different <a href="Events.html">events centered on GAMA</a> have shown that one day is enough to acquire sufficient skills in writing complete models in GAML).</p>
<p>The documentation on GAML is organized in 5 main points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description of the general structure of a model: see <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/WikiOnly/ModelOrganization.html">this page</a>
<ul>
<li>Description of the declaration of species (and all their components): see <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/WikiOnly/ManipulateBasicSpecies.html">this page</a> and all its subpages</li>
<li>Description of the declaration of experiments: see <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/WikiOnly/DefiningGUIExperiment.html">this page</a> for regular experiments and <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/WikiOnly/BatchExperiments.html">this one</a> for batch experiments.</li>
<li>Reference of the <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/WikiOnly/GamlReference.html">language</a> regarding all the structures provided to modelers</li>
<li>Recipes of how to use special or advanced features offered in GAML: see this <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/WikiOnly/Recipes.html">page</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, some of the fundamental concepts behind GAML are also described in detail, both on the <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/WikiOnly/Introduction.html">modeling infrastructure</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/WikiOnly/RuntimeConcepts.html">runtime infrastructure</a> on which GAML is relying to run experiments on models.</p>
