<table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>As soon as an experiment is <a href="LaunchingExperiments.html">launched</a>, the modeler is facing a new environment (with different menus and views) called the <em>Simulation Perspective</em>). The <em>Navigator</em> is still opened in this perspective, though, and it is still possible to <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/References/PlatformDocumentation/RunningExperiments/EditingModels.html">edit models</a> in it, but it is considered as good practice to use each perspective for what is has been designed for. Switching perspectives is easy. The small button in the top-left corner of the window allows to switch back and forth the two perspectives.</p>

<p>The actual contents of the simulation perspective will depend on the experiment being run and the <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/References/PlatformDocumentation/RunningExperiments/G__DefiningOutputs.html">outputs it defines</a>. The next sections will present the most common ones (<a href="InspectorsAndMonitors.html">inspectors, monitors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wiki/gama-platform/gama/References/PlatformDocumentation/RunningExperiments/G__Display.html">displays</a>), as well as the views that are not defined in outputs, like the <a href="ParametersView.html">Parameters</a> or <a href="ErrorsView.html">Errors view</a>. An overview of the <a href="MenusAndCommands.html">menus and commands</a> specific to the simulation perspective is also available.</p>
