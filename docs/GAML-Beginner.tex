\chapter{Java version}\label{java-version}

Due to changes in the libraries used by GAMA 1.7 and 1.8, this version
now \textbf{requires JDK/JVM 1.8} to run. Please note that GAMA
\textbf{has not been tested with JDK 1.9 and 1.10}.

\section{Changes between 1.6.1 and 1.7/1.8 that can influence the
dynamics of
models}\label{changes-between-1.6.1-and-1.71.8-that-can-influence-the-dynamics-of-models}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Initialization order between the initialization of variables and the
  execution of the \texttt{init} block in grids init -\textgreater{}
  vars in 1.6.1 / vars -\textgreater{} init in 1.7
\item
  Initialization order of agents -\textgreater{} now, the init block of
  the agents are not executed at the end of the global init, but during
  it. put a sample model to explain the order of creation and its
  differences
\item
  Initialization of vars to their default value map ? list ?
\item
  Systematic casting and verification of types give examples
\item
  header of CSV files: be careful, in GAMA 1.7, if the first line is
  detected as a header, it is not read when the file is casted as a
  matrix (so the first row of the matrix is not the header, but the
  first line of data) gives examples
\item
  the step of batch experiments is now executed after all repetitions of
  simulations are done (not after each one). They can however be still
  accessed using the attributes \texttt{simulations} (see Batch.gaml in
  Models Library)
\item
  signal and diffuse have been merged into a single statement
\item
  facets do not accept a space between their identifier and the
  \texttt{:} anymore.
\item
  simplification of equation/solve statements and deprecation of old
  facets
\item
  in FIPA skill, \texttt{content}is replaced everywhere with
  \texttt{contents}
\item
  in FIPA skill, \texttt{receivers} is replaced everywhere with
  \texttt{to}
\item
  in FIPA skill, \texttt{messages} is replaced by \texttt{mailbox}
\item
  The pseudo-attribute \texttt{user\_location} has been removed (not
  deprecated, unfortunately) and replaced by the ``unit''
  \texttt{\#user\_location}.
\item
  The actions called by an \texttt{event} layer do not need anymore to
  define \texttt{point} and \texttt{list\textless{}agent\textgreater{}}
  arguments to receive the mouse location and the list of agents
  selected. Instead, they can now use \texttt{\#user\_location} and they
  have to compute the selected agents by themselves (using an arbitrary
  function).
\item
  The random number generators now better handle seeding (larger range),
  but it can change the series of values previously obtained from a
  given seed in 1.6.1
\item
  all models now have a starting\_date and a current\_date. They then
  dont begin at an hypothetical ``zero'' date, but at the epoch date
  defined by ISO 8601 (1970/1/1). It should not change models that dont
  rely on dates, except that:
\item
  the \#year (and its nicknames \#y, \#years) and \#month (and its
  nickname \#month) do not longer have a default value (of resp. 30 days
  and 360 days). Instead, they are always evaluated against the
  current\_date of the model. If no starting\_date is defined, the
  values of \#month and \#year will then depend on the sequence of
  months and year since epoch day.
\item
  \texttt{as\_time}, \texttt{as\_system\_time}, \texttt{as\_date} and
  \texttt{as\_system\_date} have been removed
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Enhancements in 1.7/1.8}\label{enhancements-in-1.71.8}

\section{Simulations}\label{simulations}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  simulations can now be run in parallel withing an experiment (with
  their outputs, displays, etc.)
\item
  batch experiments inherit from this possibility and can now run their
  repetitions in parallel too.
\item
  concurrency between agents is now possible and can be controlled on a
  species/grid/ask basis (from multi-threaded concurrency to complete
  parallelism within a species/grid or between the targets of an
  \texttt{ask} statement)
\end{itemize}

\section{Language}\label{language}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{gama} : a new immutable agent that can be invoked to change
  preferences or access to platform-only properties (like
  \texttt{machine-time})
\item
  \texttt{abort}: a new behavior (like \texttt{reflex} or \texttt{init})
  that is executed once when the agent is about to die
\item
  \texttt{try} and \texttt{catch} statements now provide a robust way to
  catch errors happening in the simulations.
\item
  \texttt{super} (instead of \texttt{self}) and \texttt{invoke} (instead
  of \texttt{do}) can now be used to call an action defined in a parent
  species.
\item
  \texttt{date} : new data type that offers the possibility to use a
  real calendar, to define a \texttt{starting\_date} and to query a
  \texttt{current\_date} from a simulation, to parse dates from date
  files or to output them in custom formats. Dates can be added,
  subtracted, compared. Various new operators (\texttt{minus\_months},
  etc.) allow for a fine manipulation of their data. Time units
  (\texttt{\#sec}, \texttt{\#s}, \texttt{\#mn}, \texttt{\#minute},
  \texttt{\#h}, \texttt{\#hour}, \texttt{\#day}, etc.) can be used in
  conjunction with them. Interval of dates (date1 to date2) can be
  created and used as a basis for loops, etc. Various simple operators
  allow for defining conditions based on the current\_date
  (after(date1), before(date2), since(date1), etc.).
\item
  \texttt{font} type allows to define fonts more precisely in
  \texttt{draw} statements
\item
  BDI control architecture for agents
\item
  file management, new operators, new statements, new skills(?), new
  built-in variables, files can now download their contents from the web
  by using standard http: https: addresses instead of file paths.
\item
  The \texttt{save} can now directly manipulate files and \ldots{} save
  them. So something like
  \texttt{save\ shape\_file("bb.shp",\ my\_agents\ collect\ each.shape);}
  is possible. In addition, a new facet \texttt{attributes} allows to
  define complex attributes to be saved.
\item
  \texttt{assert} has a simpler syntax and can be used in any behaviour
  to raise an error if a condition is not met.
\item
  \texttt{test} is a new type of experiments
  (\texttt{experiment\ aaa\ type:\ test\ ...}), equivalent to a
  \texttt{batch} with an exhaustive search method, which automatically
  displays the status of tests found in the model.
\item
  new operators (\texttt{sum\_of}, \texttt{product\_of}, etc.)
\item
  casting of files works
\item
  co-modeling (importation of micro-models that can be managed within a
  macro-model)
\item
  populations of agents can now be easily exported to CSV files using
  the \texttt{save} statement
\item
  Simple \texttt{messaging} skill between agents\\
\item
  Terminal commands can now be issued from within GAMA using the
  \texttt{console} operator
\item
  New \texttt{status} statement allows to change the text of the status.
\item
  light statement in 3D display provides the possibility to custom your
  lights (point lights, direction lights, spot lights)
\item
  Displays can now inherit from other displays (facets \texttt{parent}
  and \texttt{virtual} to describe abstract displays)
\item
  \texttt{on\_change:} facet for attributes/parameters allows to define
  a sequence of statements to run whenever the value changes.
\item
  \texttt{species} and \texttt{experiment} now support the
  \texttt{virtual} boolean facet (virtual species can not be
  instantiated, and virtual experiments do not show up).
\item
  \texttt{experiment} now supports the \texttt{auto\_run} boolean facet
  (to run automatically when launched)
\item
  \texttt{experiment} now supports the \texttt{benchmark} boolean facet
  (to produce a CSV summary of the time spent in the different
  statements / operators of GAMA)
\item
  experiments can now have their own file (\texttt{xxx.experiment}) and
  specify the model they are targeting by providing the path to the
  model in the new \texttt{model:} facet (similar to \texttt{import}).
\item
  experiments can sport a new type: \texttt{test}, a specialised type of
  batch experiment that can be run automatically from the GUI or in
  headless and reports back the result of the tests found in its model
\end{itemize}

  cleans the metadata and recompiles the models in order to obtain a
  ``fresh'' workspace again
\item
  A search control allows to instantaneously find models based on their
  names (not contents)
\item

\chapter{Learn GAML (Beginner -I)}\label{learn-gaml-beginner--i}

If you are a beginner, the next 4 chapters will introduce you to the
GAML language. To learn the language, follow this recommended sequence:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Literals
\item
  Types or Data Types
\item
  File Types
\item
  Pseudo-variables
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{literals}{\chapter{Literals}\label{literals}}

\emph{(some literal expressions are also described in
\href{DataTypes}{data types})}

A literal is a way to specify an unnamed constant value corresponding to
a given data type. GAML supports various types of literals for often ---
or less often --- used data types.

\hypertarget{table-of-contents}{\section{Table of
contents}\label{table-of-contents}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{literals}{Literals}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{simple-types}{Simple Types}
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{literal-constructors}{Literal Constructors}
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{universal-literal}{Universal Literal}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{simple-types}{\section{Simple Types}\label{simple-types}}

Values of simple (i.e.~not composed) types can all be expressed using
literal expressions. Namely:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{bool}: \texttt{true} and \texttt{false}.
\item
  \textbf{int}: decimal value, such as \texttt{100}, or hexadecimal
  value if preceded by \texttt{\textquotesingle{}\#\textquotesingle{}}
  (e.g. \texttt{\#AAAAAA}, which returns the int \texttt{11184810})
\item
  \textbf{float}: the value in plain digits, using
  \texttt{\textquotesingle{}.\textquotesingle{}} for the decimal point
  (e.g. \texttt{123.297})
\item
  \textbf{string}: a sequence of characters enclosed between quotes
  (\texttt{\textquotesingle{}my\ string\textquotesingle{}}) or double
  quotes (\texttt{"my\ string"})
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{literal-constructors}{\section{Literal
Constructors}\label{literal-constructors}}

Although they are not strictly literals in the sense given above, some
special constructs (called \emph{literal constructors}) allow the
modeler to declare constants of other data types. They are actually
\href{Operators}{operators} but can be thought of literals when used
with constant operands.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{pair}: the key and the value separated by \texttt{::} (e.g.
  \texttt{12::\textquotesingle{}abc\textquotesingle{}})
\item
  \textbf{list}: the elements, separated by commas, enclosed inside
  square brackets (e.g. \texttt{{[}12,15,15{]}})
\item
  \textbf{map}: a list of pairs (e.g.
  \texttt{{[}12::\textquotesingle{}abc\textquotesingle{},\ 13::\textquotesingle{}def\textquotesingle{}{]}})
\item
  \textbf{point}: 2 or 3 int or float ordinates enclosed inside curly
  brackets (e.g. \texttt{\{10.0,10.0,10.0\}})
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{universal-literal}{\section{Universal
Literal}\label{universal-literal}}

Finally, a special literal, of type \texttt{unknown}, is shared between
the data types and all the agent types (aka species). Only
\texttt{bool}, \texttt{int} and \texttt{float}, which do not derive from
\texttt{unknown}, do not accept this literal. All the others will accept
it (e.g. \texttt{string\ s\ \textless{}-\ nil;} is ok).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{unknown}: \texttt{nil}, which represents the non-initialized
  (or, literally, \emph{unknown}) value.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Types}\label{types}

A variable's or expression's \emph{type} (or \emph{data type})
determines the values it can take, plus the operations that can be
performed on or with it. GAML is a statically-typed language, which
means that the type of an expression is always known at compile time,
and is even enforced with casting operations. There are 4 categories of
types:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  primitive types, declared as keyword in the language,
\item
  complex types, also declared as keyword in the language,
\item
  parametric types, a refinement of complex types (mainly children of
  container) that is dynamically constructed using an enclosing type, a
  contents type and a key type,
\item
  species types, dynamically constructed from the species declarations
  made by the modeler (and the built-in species present).
\end{itemize}

The hierarchy of types in GAML (only primitive and complex types are
displayed here, of course, as the other ones are model-dependent) is the
following:

types}\label{primitive-built-in-types}}

\hypertarget{bool}{\subsection{bool}\label{bool}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} primitive datatype providing two values:
  \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} both \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}
  are interpreted as boolean constants.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} expressions that require a boolean
  operand often directly apply a casting to bool to their operand. It is
  a convenient way to directly obtain a bool value.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
bool (0) -> false
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{float}{\subsection{float}\label{float}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} primitive datatype holding floating point values,
  its absolute value is comprised between 4.9E-324 and 1.8E308.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} this datatype is internally backed up by the Java
  double datatype.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} decimal notation 123.45 or exponential
  notation 123e45 are supported.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} expressions that require an integer
  operand often directly apply a casting to float to their operand.
  Using it is a way to obtain a float constant.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
float (12) -> 12.0
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{int}{\subsection{int}\label{int}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} primitive datatype holding integer values
  comprised between -2147483648 and 2147483647 (i.e.~between
  \texttt{-2\^{}31} and \texttt{2\^{}31\ -\ 1}.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} this datatype is internally backed up by the Java
  int datatype.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} decimal notation like 1, 256790 or
  hexadecimal notation like \#1209FF are automatically interpreted.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} expressions that require an integer
  operand often directly apply a casting to int to their operand. Using
  it is a way to obtain an integer constant.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
int (234.5) -> 234.
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{string}{\subsection{string}\label{string}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype holding a sequence of characters.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} this datatype is internally backed up by the Java
  String class. However, contrary to Java, strings are considered as a
  primitive type, which means they do not contain character objects.
  This can be seen when casting a string to a list using the list
  operator: the result is a list of one-character strings, not a list of
  characters.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} a sequence of characters enclosed in
  quotes, like `this is a string' . If one wants to literally declare
  strings that contain quotes, one has to double these quotes in the
  declaration. Strings accept escape characters like
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}n} (newline), \texttt{\textbackslash{}r}
  (carriage return), \texttt{\textbackslash{}t} (tabulation), as well as
  any Unicode character (\texttt{\textbackslash{}uXXXX}).
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} see string
\item
  \textbf{Example:} see
  \href{Operators\#strings-related-operators}{string operators}.
\end{itemize}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{complex-built-in-types}{\section{Complex built-in
types}\label{complex-built-in-types}}

Contrarily to primitive built-in types, complex types have often various
attributes. They can be accessed in the same way as attributes of
agents:

\begin{verbatim}
complex_type nom_var <- init_var;
ltype_attr attr_var <- nom_var.attr_name;
\end{verbatim}

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
file fileText <- file("../data/cell.Data");
bool fileTextReadable <- fileText.readable;
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{agent}{\subsection{agent}\label{agent}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a generic datatype that represents an agent
  whatever its actual species.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} This datatype is barely used, since species can be
  directly used as datatypes themselves.
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} the agent casting operator can be applied to an
  int (to get the agent with this unique index), a string (to get the
  agent with this name).
\end{itemize}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{container}{\subsection{container}\label{container}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a generic datatype that represents a collection
  of data.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} a container variable can be a list, a matrix, a
  map\ldots{} Conversely each list, matrix and map is a kind of
  container. In consequence every container can be used in
  container-related operators.
\item
  \textbf{See also:}
  \href{Operators\#containers-related-operators}{Container operators}
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:}

\begin{verbatim}
container c  <- [1,2,3];
container c  <- matrix [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]];
container c  <- map ["x"::5, "y"::12];
container c  <- list species1;
\end{verbatim}

  \protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{file}{\subsection{file}\label{file}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype that represents a file.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    name (type = string): the name of the represented file (with its
    extension)
  \item
    extension(type = string): the extension of the file
  \item
    path (type = string): the absolute path of the file
  \item
    readable (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the
    file is readable
  \item
    writable (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the
    file is writable
  \item
    exists (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the file
    exists
  \item
    is\_folder (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the
    file is folder
  \item
    contents (type = container): a container storing the content of the
    file
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} a variable with the \texttt{file} type can handle
  any kind of file (text, image or shape files\ldots{}). The type of the
  \texttt{content} attribute will depend on the kind of file. Note that
  the allowed kinds of file are the followings:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    text files: files with the extensions .txt, .data, .csv, .text,
    .tsv, .asc. The \texttt{content} is by default a list of string.
  \item
    image files: files with the extensions .pgm, .tif, .tiff, .jpg,
    .jpeg, .png, .gif, .pict, .bmp. The \texttt{content} is by default a
    matrix of int.
  \item
    shapefiles: files with the extension .shp. The \texttt{content} is
    by default a list of geometry.
  \item
    properties files: files with the extension .properties. The
    \texttt{content} is by default a map of string::string.
  \item
    folders. The \texttt{content} is by default a list of string.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} Files are also a particular kind of container and can
  thus be read, written or iterated using the container operators and
  commands.
\item
  \textbf{See also:} \href{Operators\#files-related-operators}{File
  operators}
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} a file can be created using the generic
  \texttt{file} (that opens a file in read only mode and tries to
  determine its contents), \texttt{folder} or the \texttt{new\_folder}
  (to open an existing folder or create a new one) unary operators. But
  things can be specialized with the combination of the
  \texttt{read}/\texttt{write} and
  \texttt{image}/\texttt{text}/\texttt{shapefile}/\texttt{properties}
  unary operators.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
folder(a_string)  // returns a file managing a existing folder
file(a_string) // returns any kind of file in read-only mode
read(text(a_string)) // returns a text file in read-only mode
read(image(a_string)) // does the same with an image file.
write(properties(a_string)) // returns a property file which is available for writing 
                            // (if it exists, contents will be appended unless it is cleared 
                            // using the standard container operations).
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{geometry}{\subsection{geometry}\label{geometry}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype that represents a vector geometry,
  i.e.~a list of georeferenced points.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    location (type = point): the centroid of the geometry
  \item
    area (type = float): the area of the geometry
  \item
    perimeter (type = float): the perimeter of the geometry
  \item
    holes (type = list of geometry): the list of the hole inside the
    given geometry
  \item
    contour (type = geometry): the exterior ring of the given geometry
    and of his holes
  \item
    envelope (type = geometry): the geometry bounding box
  \item
    width (type = float): the width of the bounding box
  \item
    height (type = float): the height of the bounding box
  \item
    points (type = list of point): the set of the points composing the
    geometry
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} a geometry can be either a point, a polyline or a
  polygon. Operators working on geometries handle transparently these
  three kinds of geometry. The envelope (a.k.a. the bounding box) of the
  geometry depends on the kind of geometry:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If this Geometry is the empty geometry, it is an empty point.
  \item
    If the Geometry is a point, it is a non-empty point.
  \item
    Otherwise, it is a Polygon whose points are (minx, miny), (maxx,
    miny), (maxx, maxy), (minx, maxy), (minx, miny).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{See also:} \href{Operators\#spatial-operators}{Spatial
  operators}
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} geometries can be built from a point, a list of
  points or by using specific operators (circle, square,
  triangle\ldots{}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
geometry varGeom <- circle(5);
geometry polygonGeom <- polygon([{3,5}, {5,6},{1,4}]);
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{graph}{\subsection{graph}\label{graph}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype that represents a graph composed of
  vertices linked by edges.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    edges(type = list of agent/geometry): the list of all edges
  \item
    vertices(type = list of agent/geometry): the list of all vertices
  \item
    circuit (type = path): an approximate minimal traveling salesman
    tour (hamiltonian cycle)
  \item
    spanning\_tree (type = list of agent/geometry): minimum spanning
    tree of the graph, i.e.~a sub-graph such as every vertex lies in the
    tree, and as much edges lies in it but no cycles (or loops) are
    formed.
  \item
    connected(type = bool): test whether the graph is connected
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Remark:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    graphs are also a particular kind of container and can thus be
    manipulated using the container operators and commands.
  \item
    This algorithm used to compute the circuit requires that the graph
    be complete and the triangle inequality exists (if x,y,z are
    vertices then d(x,y)+d(y,z)\textless{}d(x,z) for all x,y,z) then
    this algorithm will guarantee a hamiltonian cycle such that the
    total weight of the cycle is less than or equal to double the total
    weight of the optimal hamiltonian cycle.
  \item
    The computation of the spanning tree uses an implementation of the
    Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. If the given graph is
    connected it computes the minimum spanning tree, otherwise it
    computes the minimum spanning forest.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{See also:} \href{Operators\#graph-related-operators}{Graph
  operators}
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} graphs can be built from a list of vertices
  (agents or geometries) or from a list of edges (agents or geometries)
  by using specific operators. They are often used to deal with a road
  network and are built from a shapefile.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
create road from: shape_file_road;
graph the_graph <- as_edge_graph(road);

graph([1,9,5])        --: ([1: in[] + out[], 5: in[] + out[], 9: in[] + out[]], [])
graph([node(0), node(1), node(2)]      // if node is a species
graph(['a'::345, 'b'::13])  --:  ([b: in[] + out[b::13], a: in[] + out[a::345], 13: in[b::13] + out[], 345: in[a::345] + out[]], [a::345=(a,345), b::13=(b,13)])
graph(a_graph)  --: a_graph
graph(node1)    --: null
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{list}{\subsection{list}\label{list}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a composite datatype holding an ordered
  collection of values.
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} lists are more or less equivalent to instances of
  ArrayList in Java (although they are backed up by a specific class).
  They grow and shrink as needed, can be accessed via an index (see @ or
  index\_of), support set operations (like union and difference), and
  provide the modeller with a number of utilities that make it easy to
  deal with collections of agents (see, for instance, shuffle,
  reverse,where,sort\_by,\ldots{}).
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} lists can contain values of any datatypes, including
  other lists. Note, however, that due to limitations in the current
  parser, lists of lists cannot be declared litteraly; they have to be
  built using assignments. Lists are also a particular kind of container
  and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and
  commands.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} a set of expressions separated by
  commas, enclosed in square brackets, like {[}12, 14, `abc', self{]}.
  An empty list is noted \href{}{}.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} lists can be build litteraly from a
  point, or a string, or any other element by using the list casting
  operator.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
list (1) -> [1]
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
list<int> myList <- [1,2,3,4]; 
myList[2] => 3
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{map}{\subsection{map}\label{map}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a composite datatype holding an ordered
  collection of pairs (a key, and its associated value).
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    keys (type = list): the list of all keys
  \item
    values (type = list): the list of all values
  \item
    pairs (type = list of pairs): the list of all pairs key::value
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} maps are more or less equivalent to instances of
  Hashtable in Java (although they are backed up by a specific class).
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} maps can contain values of any datatypes, including
  other maps or lists. Maps are also a particular kind of container and
  can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} a set of pair expressions separated by
  commas, enclosed in square brackets; each pair is represented by a key
  and a value sperarated by `::'. An example of map is {[}agentA::`big',
  agentB::`small', agentC::`big'{]}. An empty map is noted \href{}{}.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} lists can be built litteraly from a
  point, or a string, or any other element by using the map casting
  operator.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
map (1) -> [1::1]
map ({1,5}) -> [x::1, y::5]
[]   // empty map 
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{matrix}{\subsection{matrix}\label{matrix}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a composite datatype that represents either a
  two-dimension array (matrix) or a one-dimension array (vector),
  holding any type of data (including other matrices).
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} Matrices are fixed-size structures that can be
  accessed by index (point for two-dimensions matrices, integer for
  vectors).
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} Matrices cannot be defined literally.
  One-dimensions matrices can be built by using the matrix casting
  operator applied on a list. Two-dimensions matrices need to to be
  declared as variables first, before being filled.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
//builds a one-dimension matrix, of size 5
matrix mat1 <- matrix ([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]);
//  builds a two-dimensions matrix with 10 columns and 5 rows, where each cell is initialized to 0.0
matrix mat2 <- 0.0 as_matrix({10,5}); 
// builds a two-dimensions matrix with 2 columns and 3 rows, with initialized cells
matrix mat3 <- matrix([["c11","c12","c13"],["c21","c22","c23"]]);     
    -> c11;c21
       c12;c22
       c13;c23
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{pair}{\subsection{pair}\label{pair}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype holding a key and its associated
  value.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    key (type = string): the key of the pair, i.e.~the first element of
    the pair
  \item
    value (type = string): the value of the pair, i.e.~the second
    element of the pair
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} pairs are also a particular kind of container and can
  thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} a pair is defined by a key and a value
  sperarated by `::'.
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} a pair can also be built from:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a point,
  \item
    a map (in this case the first element of the pair is the list of all
    the keys of the map and the second element is the list of all the
    values of the map),
  \item
    a list (in this case the two first element of the list are used to
    built the pair)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
pair testPair <- "key"::56;
pair testPairPoint <- {3,5};             // 3::5
pair testPairList2 <- [6,7,8];           // 6::7
pair testPairMap <- [2::6,5::8,12::45];  // [12,5,2]::[45,8,6]
\end{verbatim}

\protect\hyperlink{table-of-contents}{Top of the page}

\hypertarget{path}{\subsection{path}\label{path}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype representing a path linking two agents
  or geometries in a graph.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    source (type = point): the source point, i.e.~the first point of the
    path
  \item
    target (type = point): the target point, i.e.~the last point of the
    path
  \item
    graph (type = graph): the current topology (in the case it is a
    spatial graph), null otherwise
  \item
    edges (type = list of agents/geometries) : the edges of the graph
    composing the path
  \item
    vertices (type = list of agents/geometries) : the vertices of the
    graph composing the path
  \item
    segments (type = list of geometries): the list of the geometries
    composing the path
  \item
    shape (type = geometry) : the global geometry of the path (polyline)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} the path created between two agents/geometries or
  locations will strongly depends on the topology in which it is
  created.
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} a path is \textbf{immutable}, i.e.~it can not be
  modified after it is created.
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} paths are very barely defined litterally. We can
  nevertheless use the \texttt{path} unary operator on a list of points
  to build a path. Operators dedicated to the computation of paths (such
  as path\_to or path\_between) are often used to build a path.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
path([{1,5},{2,9},{5,8}]) // a path from {1,5} to {5,8} through {2,9}
       
geometry rect <- rectangle(5);
geometry poly <- polygon([{10,20},{11,21},{10,21},{11,22}]);

\hypertarget{point}{\subsection{point}\label{point}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype normally holding two positive float
  values. Represents the absolute coordinates of agents in the model.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    x (type = float): coordinate of the point on the x-axis
  \item
    y (type = float): coordinate of the point on the y-axis
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} point coordinates should be positive, if a negative
  value is used in its declaration, the point is built with the absolute
  value.
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} points are particular cases of geometries and
  containers. Thus they have also all the built-in attributes of both
  the geometry and the container datatypes and can be used with every
  kind of operator or command admitting geometry and container.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} two numbers, separated by a comma,
  enclosed in braces, like \{12.3, 14.5\}
\item
  \textbf{Other declarations:} points can be built litteraly from a
  list, or from an integer or float value by using the point casting
  operator.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{rgb}{\subsection{rgb}\label{rgb}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a datatype that represents a color in the RGB
  space.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    red(type = int): the red component of the color
  \item
    green(type = int): the green component of the color
  \item
    blue(type = int): the blue component of the color
  \item
    darker(type = rgb): a new color that is a darker version of this
    color
  \item
    brighter(type = rgb): a new color that is a brighter version of this
    color
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} rgbs are also a particular kind of container and can
  thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.
\item
  \textbf{Litteral declaration:} there exist lot of ways to declare a
  color. We use the \texttt{rgb} casting operator applied to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a string. The allowed color names are the constants defined in the
    Color Java class, i.e.: black, blue, cyan, darkGray, lightGray,
    gray, green, magenta, orange, pink, red, white, yellow.
  \item
    a list. The integer value associated to the three first elements of
    the list are used to define the three red (element 0 of the list),
    green (element 1 of the list) and blue (element 2 of the list)
    components of the color.
  \item
    a map. The red, green, blue compoenents take the value associated to
    the keys ``r'', ``g'', ``b'' in the map.
  \item
    an integer \textless{}- the decimal integer is translated into a
    hexadecimal \textless{}- OxRRGGBB. The red (resp. green, blue)
    component of the color take the value RR (resp. GG, BB) translated
    in decimal.
  \item
    Since GAMA 1.6.1, colors can be directly obtained like units, by
    using the ° or \# symbol followed by the name in lowercase of one of
    the 147 CSS colors (see
    \url{http://www.cssportal.com/css3-color-names/}).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
rgb cssRed <- #red;   // Since 1.6.1
rgb testColor <- rgb('white');                 // rgb [255,255,255]

\hypertarget{species}{\subsection{species}\label{species}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Definition: a generic datatype that represents a species
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    topology (type=topology): the topology is which lives the population
    of agents
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Comments: this datatype is actually a ``meta-type''. It allows to
  manipulate (in a rather limited fashion, however) the species
  themselves as any other values.
\item
  Litteral declaration: the name of a declared species is already a
  litteral declaration of species.
\item
  Other declarations: the species casting operator, or its variant
  called species\_of can be applied to an agent in order to get its
  species.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{species-names-as-types}{\subsection{Species names as
types}\label{species-names-as-types}}

Once a species has been declared in a model, it automatically becomes a
datatype. This means that : * It can be used to declare variables,
parameters or constants, * It can be used as an operand to commands or
operators that require species parameters, * It can be used as a casting
operator (with the same capabilities as the built-in type agent)

In the simple following example, we create a set of ``humans'' and
initialize a random ``friendship network'' among them. See how the name
of the species, human, is used in the create command, as an argument to
the list casting operator, and as the type of the variable named friend.

\begin{verbatim}
global {
    init {
         create human number: 10;
         ask human {
               friend <- one_of (human - self);
         }
     }
}
entities {
    species human {
        human friend <- nil;
    }
}

\hypertarget{topology}{\subsection{topology}\label{topology}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition:} a topology is basically on neighborhoods,
  distance,\ldots{} structures in which agents evolves. It is the
  environment or the context in which all these values are computed. It
  also provides the access to the spatial index shared by all the
  agents. And it maintains a (eventually dynamic) link with the
  `environment' which is a geometrical border.
\item
  \textbf{Built-in attributes:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    places(type = container): the collection of places (geometry)
    defined by this topology.
  \item
    environment(type = geometry): the environment of this topology
    (i.e.~the geometry that defines its boundaries)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Comments:} the attributes \texttt{places} depends on the kind
  of the considered topolopy. For continuous topologies, it is a list
  with their environment. For discrete topologies, it can be any of the
  container supporting the inclusion of geometries (list, graph, map,
  matrix)
\item
  \textbf{Remark:} There exist various kinds of topology: continuous
  topology and discrete topology (e.g.~grid, graph\ldots{})
\item
  \textbf{Declaration:} To create a topology, we can use the
  \texttt{topology} unary casting operator applied to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    an agent: returns a continuous topology built from the agent's
    geometry
  \item
    a species name: returns the topology defined for this species
    population
  \item
    a geometry: returns a continuous topology built on this geometry
  \item
    a geometry container (list, map, shapefile): returns an
    half-discrete (with corresponding places), half-continuous topology
    (to compute distances\ldots{})
  \item
    a geometry matrix (i.e.~a grid): returns a grid topology which
    computes specifically neighborhood and distances
  \item
    a geometry graph: returns a graph topology which computes
    specifically neighborhood and distances More complex topologies can
    also be built using dedicated operators, e.g.~to decompose a
    geometry\ldots{}

\hypertarget{defining-custom-types}{\section{Defining custom
types}\label{defining-custom-types}}

Sometimes, besides the species of agents that compose the model, it can
be necessary to declare custom datatypes. Species serve this purpose as
well, and can be seen as ``classes'' that can help to instantiate simple
``objects''. In the following example, we declare a new kind of
``object'', bottle, that lacks the skills habitually associated with
agents (moving, visible, etc.), but can nevertheless group together
attributes and behaviors within the same closure. The following example
demonstrates how to create the species:

\begin{verbatim}
species bottle {
    float volume <- 0.0 max:1 min:0.0;
    bool is_empty -> {volume = 0.0};
    action fill {
         volume <- 1.0;
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

How to use this species to declare new bottles :

\begin{verbatim}
create bottle {
    volume <- 0.5;
}
\end{verbatim}

And how to use bottles as any other agent in a species (a drinker owns a
bottle; when he gets thirsty, it drinks a random quantity from it; when
it is empty, it refills it):

\begin{verbatim}
species drinker {
     ...
    bottle my_bottle<- nil;
    float quantity <- rnd (100) / 100;
    bool thirsty <- false update: flip (0.1);
    ...
    action drink {
         if condition: ! bottle.is_empty {
              bottle.volume <-bottle.volume - quantity;
              thirsty <- false;
         }
    }
    ...
    init {
          create bottle return: created_bottle;
              volume <- 0.5;
          }
          my_bottle <- first(created_bottle);
    }
    ...
    reflex filling_bottle when: bottle.is_empty {
         ask  my_bottle {
              do fill;
         }
    }
    ...
    reflex drinking when: thirsty {
         do drink;
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{file-types}{\chapter{File Types}\label{file-types}}

GAMA provides modelers with a generic type for files called
\textbf{file}. It is possible to load a file using the \emph{file}
operator:

\begin{verbatim}
file my_file <- file("../includes/data.csv");
\end{verbatim}

However, internally, GAMA makes the difference between the different
types of files. Indeed, for instance:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
    init {
        file my_file <- file("../includes/data.csv");
        loop el over: my_file {
            write el;
        }
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

will give:

\begin{verbatim}
sepallength
sepalwidth
petallength
petalwidth
type
5.1
3.5
1.4
0.2
Iris-setosa
4.9
3.0
1.4
0.2
Iris-setosa
...
\end{verbatim}

Indeed, the content of CSV file is a matrix: each row of the matrix is a
line of the file; each column of the matrix is value delimited by the
separator (by default ``,'').

In contrary:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
    init {
        file my_file <- file("../includes/data.shp");
        loop el over: my_file {
            write el;
        }
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

will give:

\begin{verbatim}
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
Polygon
\end{verbatim}

The content of a shapefile is a list of geometries corresponding to the
objects of the shapefile.

In order to know how to load a file, GAMA analyzes its extension. For
instance for a file with a ``.csv'' extension, GAMA knows that the file
is a \textbf{csv} one and will try to split each line with the \emph{,}
separator. However, if the modeler wants to split each line with a
different separator (for instance \textbf{;}) or load it as a text file,
he/she will have to use a specific file operator.

Indeed, GAMA integrates specific operators corresponding to different
types of files.

\hypertarget{shapefile}{\section{Shapefile}\label{shapefile}}

Shapefiles are classical GIS data files. A shapefile is not simple file,
but a set of several files (source: wikipedia): * Mandatory files : *
.shp --- shape format; the feature geometry itself * .shx --- shape
index format; a positional index of the feature geometry to allow
seeking forwards and backwards quickly * .dbf --- attribute format;
columnar attributes for each shape, in dBase IV format

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Optional files :

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    .prj --- projection format; the coordinate system and projection
    information, a plain text file describing the projection using
    well-known text format
  \item
    .sbn and .sbx --- a spatial index of the features
  \item
    .fbn and .fbx --- a spatial index of the features for shapefiles
    that are read-only
  \item
    .ain and .aih --- an attribute index of the active fields in a table
  \item
    .ixs --- a geocoding index for read-write shapefiles
  \item
    .mxs --- a geocoding index for read-write shapefiles (ODB format)
  \item
    .atx --- an attribute index for the .dbf file in the form of
    shapefile.columnname.atx (ArcGIS 8 and later)
  \item
    .shp.xml --- geospatial metadata in XML format, such as ISO 19115 or
    other XML schema
  \item
    .cpg --- used to specify the code page (only for .dbf) for
    identifying the character encoding to be used

\subsection{Extensions}\label{extensions-2}

Here the list of possible extension for shapefile: * ``shp''

\subsection{Content}\label{content-2}

The content of a shapefile is a list of geometries corresponding to the
objects of the shapefile. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
global {
    init {
        file my_file <- shape_file("../includes/data.shp");
        loop el over: my_file {

...
\end{verbatim}

Note that the attributes of each object of the shapefile is stored in
their corresponding GAMA geometry. The operator ``get'' (or ``read'')
allows to get the value of a corresponding attributes.

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
file my_file <- shape_file("../includes/data.shp");
write "my_file: " + my_file.contents;
loop el over: my_file {
    write (el get "TYPE");
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Operators}\label{operators-2}

List of operators related to shapefiles: * \textbf{shape\_file(string
path)}: load a file (with an authorized extension) as a shapefile with
default projection (if a prj file is defined, use it, otherwise use the
default projection defined in the preference). *
\textbf{shape\_file(string path, string code)}: load a file (with an
authorized extension) as a shapefile with the given projection (GAMA
will automatically decode the code. For a list of the possible
projections see: \url{http://spatialreference.org/ref/}) *
\textbf{shape\_file(string path, int EPSG\_ID)}: load a file (with an
authorized extension) as a shapefile with the given projection (GAMA
will automatically decode the epsg code. For a list of the possible

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{osm-file}{\section{OSM File}\label{osm-file}}

OSM (Open Street Map) is a collaborative project to create a free
editable map of the world. The data produced in this project (OSM File)
represent physical features on the ground (e.g., roads or buildings)
using tags attached to its basic data structures (its nodes, ways, and
relations). Each tag describes a geographic attribute of the feature
being shown by that specific node, way or relation (source:
openstreetmap.org).

\end{verbatim}

will give:

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Note that like for shapefiles, the attributes of each object of the osm
file is stored in their corresponding GAMA geometry. The operator
``get'' (or ``read'') allows to get the value of a corresponding
attributes.

\subsection{Operators}\label{operators-3}

List of operators related to osm file: * \textbf{osm\_file(string
path)}: load a file (with an authorized extension) as a osm file with
default projection (if a prj file is defined, use it, otherwise use the
default projection defined in the preference). In this case, all the
nodes and ways of the OSM file will becomes a geometry. *
\textbf{osm\_file(string path, string code)}: load a file (with an
authorized extension) as a osm file with the given projection (GAMA will
automatically decode the code. For a list of the possible projections
see: \url{http://spatialreference.org/ref/}). In this case, all the
nodes and ways of the OSM file will becomes a geometry. *
\textbf{osm\_file(string path, int EPSG\_ID)}: load a file (with an
authorized extension) as a osm file with the given projection (GAMA will
automatically decode the epsg code. For a list of the possible
projections see: \url{http://spatialreference.org/ref/}). In this case,
all the nodes and ways of the OSM file will becomes a geometry.

\begin{verbatim}
file my_file <- osm_file("../includes/data.gz", "EPSG:32601");
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{osm\_file(string path, map filter)}: load a file (with an
  authorized extension) as a osm file with default projection (if a prj
  file is defined, use it, otherwise use the default projection defined
  in the preference). In this case, only the elements with the defined
  values are loaded from the file. ``` //map used to filter the object
  to build from the OSM file according to attributes. map filtering
  \textless{}- map({[}``highway''::{[}``primary'', ``secondary'',
  ``tertiary'', ``motorway'', ``living\_street'',``residential'',
  ``unclassified''{]}, ``building''::{[}``yes''{]}{]});
\end{itemize}

//OSM file to load file osmfile \textless{}- file

\hypertarget{pseudo-variables}{\chapter{Pseudo-variables}\label{pseudo-variables}}

The expressions known as \textbf{pseudo-variables} are special read-only
variables that are not declared anywhere (at least not in a species),
and which represent a value that changes depending on the context of
execution.

\section{Table of contents}\label{table-of-contents-3}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{pseudo-variables}{Pseudo-variables}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{self}{self}
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{myself}{myself}
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{each}{each}
  \item
    \protect\hyperlink{super}{super}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{self}{\section{self}\label{self}}

The pseudo-variable \texttt{self} always holds a reference to the agent
executing the current statement.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Example (sets the \texttt{friend} attribute of another random agent of
  the same species to \texttt{self} and conversely):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
friend potential_friend <- one_of (species(self) - self);
if potential_friend != nil {
    potential_friend.friend <- self;
    friend <- potential_friend;
}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{super}{\section{super}\label{super}}

The pseudo-variable \texttt{super} behaves exactly in the same way as
\texttt{self} except when calling an action, in which case it represents
an indirection to the parent species. It is mainly used for allowing to
call inherited actions within redefined ones. For instance:

\begin{verbatim}
species parent {

    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

}

species child parent: parent {

    int add(int a, int b) {
        // Calls the action defined in 'parent' with modified arguments
        return super.add(a + 20, b + 20);
    }

}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{myself}{\section{myself}\label{myself}}

\texttt{myself} plays the same role as \texttt{self} but in
remotely-executed code (\texttt{ask}, \texttt{create}, \texttt{capture}
and \texttt{release} statements), where it represents the \emph{calling}
agent when the code is executed by the \emph{remote} agent.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Example (asks the first agent of my species to set its color to my
  color):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
ask first (species (self)){
    color <- myself.color;
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Example (create 10 new agents of the species of my species, share the
  energy between them, turn them towards me, and make them move 4 times
  to get closer to me):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
create species (self) number: 10 {
   energy <- myself.energy / 10.0;
   loop times: 4 {
       heading <- towards (myself);
       do move;
   }
}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{each}{\section{each}\label{each}}

\texttt{each} is available only in the right-hand argument of
\href{Operators\#Iterator-operators}{iterators}. It is a pseudo-variable
that represents, in turn, each of the elements of the left-hand
container. It can then take any type depending on the context.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Example:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
    list<string> names <- my_species collect each.name;  // each is of type my_species
    int max <- max(['aa', 'bbb', 'cccc'] collect length(each)); // each is of type string
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{Learn GAML (Beginner -II)}\label{learn-gaml-beginner--ii}

If you are a beginner, the next 7 chapters will introduce you to
functions and statements in GAML language. Before you read these
chapters it is important you know what are data types. To learn the
language, follow this recommended sequence:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Operators (9-15) : This includes 6 chapters introducing you to all the
  operators (A to Z) in GAMA. Go first to the chapter \textbf{opeators
  by categories} to get a feel of the scope of operators available.
  Operators are typically like functions in other languages. They accept
  one or more arguments of the basic or complex data types and return a
  result in one of the data types.
\item
  Statements (16) : Statement is a one-line sequence of keywords
  (commands) guided with controlling arguments (facets) that operate on
  one of the data types or a combination of operators and data types. A
  typical example is:
\item
  if you want an agent1 at location A to go to a location B, then the
  following is a valid GAML statement
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{do}\NormalTok{ goto target:}\KeywordTok{B}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if you want an agent1 at location A to go to a location B with a speed
  of S, then the following is a GAML valid statement
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{do}\NormalTok{ goto target:}\KeywordTok{B}\NormalTok{ speed:}\KeywordTok{S}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if you want an agent1 at location A to go to a location B with a speed
  of S on a graph G, then the following is a GAML valid statement
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{do}\NormalTok{ goto target:}\KeywordTok{B}\NormalTok{ speed:}\KeywordTok{S}\NormalTok{ on:}\KeywordTok{G}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result}

Returns the difference of the two operands. If it is used as an unary
operator, it returns the opposite of the operand.

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment}

The behavior of the operator depends on the type of the operands.

\subsubsection{Special cases:}\label{special-cases}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if the left operand is a species and the right operand is an agent of
  the species, - returns a list containing all the agents of the species
  minus this agent\\
\item
  if both operands are containers and the right operand is empty, -
  returns the left operand\\
\item
  if both operands are dates, returns the duration in seconds between
  date2 and date1. To obtain a more precise duration, in milliseconds,
  use milliseconds\_between(date1, date2)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
float var0 <- date('2000-01-02') - date('2000-01-01'); // var0 equals 86400
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if one operand is a color and the other an integer, returns a new
  color resulting from the subtraction of each component of the color
  with the right operand
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
rgb var1 <- rgb([255, 128, 32]) - 3; // var1 equals rgb([252,125,29])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if one operand is a matrix and the other a number (float or int),
  performs a normal arithmetic difference of the number with each
  element of the matrix (results are float if the number is a float.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
matrix var2 <- 3.5 - matrix([[2,5],[3,4]]); // var2 equals matrix([[1.5,-1.5],[0.5,-0.5]])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if both operands are numbers, performs a normal arithmetic difference
  and returns a float if one of them is a float.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
int var3 <- 1 - 1; // var3 equals 0
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if left-hand operand is a point and the right-hand a number, returns a
  new point with each coordinate as the difference of the operand
  coordinate with this number.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
point var4 <- {1, 2} - 4.5; // var4 equals {-3.5, -2.5, -4.5} 
point var5 <- {1, 2} - 4; // var5 equals {-3.0,-2.0,-4.0}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if both operands are a point, a geometry or an agent, returns the
  geometry resulting from the difference between both geometries
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
geometry var6 <- geom1 - geom2; // var6 equals a geometry corresponding to difference between geom1 and geom2
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if both operands are colors, returns a new color resulting from the
  subtraction of the two operands, component by component
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
rgb var7 <- rgb([255, 128, 32]) - rgb('red'); // var7 equals rgb([0,128,32])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if one of the operands is a date and the other a number, returns a
  date corresponding to the date minus the given number as duration (in
  seconds)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
date var8 <- date('2000-01-01') - 86400; // var8 equals date('1999-12-31')
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if the left-hand operand is a geometry and the right-hand operand a
  float, returns a geometry corresponding to the left-hand operand
  (geometry, agent, point) reduced by the right-hand operand distance
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
geometry var9 <- shape - 5; // var9 equals a geometry corresponding to the geometry of the agent applying the operator reduced by a distance of 5
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if the right-operand is a list of points, geometries or agents,
  returns the geometry resulting from the difference between the
  left-geometry and all of the right-geometries
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
geometry var10 <- rectangle(10,10) - [circle(2), square(2)]; // var10 equals rectangle(10,10) - (circle(2) + square(2))
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if both operands are points, returns their difference (coordinates per
  coordinates).
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
 
point var11 <- {1, 2} - {4, 5}; // var11 equals {-3.0, -3.0}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if the left operand is a list and the right operand is an object of
  any type (except list), - returns a list containing the elements of
  the left operand minus all the occurrences of this object
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-16}

returns a new flat list, in which each element is the evaluation of the
right-hand operand. If this evaluation returns a list, the elements of
this result are added directly to the list returned

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-2}

accumulate is dedicated to the application of a same computation on each
element of a container (and returns a list). In the right-hand operand,
the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the
left-hand operand elements.

\subsubsection{Examples:}\label{examples-13}

\begin{verbatim}
 
list var0 <- [a1,a2,a3] accumulate (each neighbors_at 10); // var0 equals a flat list of all the neighbors of these three agents 
list<int> var1 <- [1,2,4] accumulate ([2,4]); // var1 equals [2,4,2,4,2,4]

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-12}

This operator is very useful to cast a file containing raster data into
a matrix.Note that both components of the right operand point should be
positive, otherwise an exception is raised.The operator as\_matrix
creates a matrix of preferred size. It fills in it with elements of the
left operand until the matrix is full If the size is to short, some
elements will be omitted. Matrix remaining elements will be filled in by
nil.

of the computed angle, which is not possible for the single-argument
arctangent function.

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-146}

The index of the best candidate according to a method based on the
ELECTRE methods. The principle of the ELECTRE methods is to compare the
possible candidates by pair. These methods analyses the possible
outranking relation existing between two candidates. An candidate
outranks another if this one is at least as good as the other one. The
ELECTRE methods are based on two concepts: the concordance and the
discordance. The concordance characterizes the fact that, for an
outranking relation to be validated, a sufficient majority of criteria
should be in favor of this assertion. The discordance characterizes the
fact that, for an outranking relation to be validated, none of the
criteria in the minority should oppose too strongly this assertion.
These two conditions must be true for validating the outranking
assertion. More information about the ELECTRE methods can be found in
{[}\url{http://www.springerlink.com/content/g367r44322876223/} Figueira,
J., Mousseau, V., Roy, B.: ELECTRE Methods. In: Figueira, J., Greco, S.,
and Ehrgott, M., (Eds.), Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of
the Art Surveys, Springer, New York, 133--162 (2005){]}. The first
operand is the list of candidates (a candidate is a list of criterion
values); the second operand the list of criterion: A criterion is a map
that contains fives elements: a name, a weight, a preference value (p),
an indifference value (q) and a veto value (v). The preference value
represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion
values allows to prefer one vector of values over another. The
indifference value represents the threshold from which the difference
between two criterion values is considered significant. The veto value
represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion
values disqualifies the candidate that obtained the smaller value; the
last operand is the fuzzy cut.

the value of the every operator depends on the cycle. It can be used to
do something every x cycle.Used to do something at regular intervals of
time. Can be used in conjunction with `since', `after', `before',
`until' or `between', so that this computation only takes place in the
temporal segment defined by these operators. In all cases, the
starting\_date of the model is used as a reference starting point

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-161}

opens a file in read only mode, creates a GAML file object, and tries to
determine and store the file content in the contents attribute. Creates
a file in read/write mode, setting its contents to the container passed
in parameter

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-36}

The file should have a supported extension, see file type definition for
supported file extensions.The type of container to pass will depend on
the type of file (see the management of files in the documentation). Can
be used to copy files since files are considered as containers. For
example: save file(`image\_copy.png', file(`image.png')); will copy
image.png to image\_copy.png

The Barabasi-Albert (BA) model is an algorithm for generating random
scale-free networks using a preferential attachment mechanism. A
scale-free network is a network whose degree distribution follows a
power law, at least asymptotically.Such networks are widely observed in

Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) is a type of deterministic method for
multivariate interpolation with a known scattered set of points. The
assigned values to each geometry are calculated with a weighted average
of the values available at the known points. See:
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting} Usage: IDW
(list of geometries, map of points (key: point, value: value), power
parameter)

\subsubsection{Examples:}\label{examples-202}

a list, containing the agents of the left-hand operand whose species is
the one denoted by the right-hand operand.The expression agents
of\_species (species self) is equivalent to agents where (species each =
species self); however, the advantage of using the first syntax is that
the resulting list is correctly typed with the right species, whereas,
in the second syntax, the parser cannot determine the species of the
agents within the list (resulting in the need to cast it explicitly if
it is to be used in an ask statement, for instance).

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that
expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a
fixed interval of time and/or space if these events occur with a known
average rate and independently of the time since the last event,
cf.~Poisson distribution on Wikipedia.

Returns true if the current\_date of the model is after (or equal to)
the date passed in argument. Synonym of `current\_date \textgreater{}=
argument'. Can be used, like `after', in its composed form with 2
arguments to express the lowest boundary of the computation of a
frequency. However, contrary to `after', there is a subtle difference:
the lowest boundary will be tested against the frequency as well

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-533}

asks the user for some values (not defined as parameters). Takes a
string (optional) and a map as arguments. The string is used to specify
the message of the dialog box. The map is to specify the parameters you
want the user to change before the simulation starts, with the name of
the parameter in string key, and the default value as value.

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-104}

This operator takes a map {[}string::value{]} as argument, displays a
dialog asking the user for these values, and returns the same map with
the modified values (if any). The dialog is modal and will interrupt the
execution of the simulation until the user has either dismissed or
accepted it. It can be used, for instance, in an init section to force
the user to input new values instead of relying on the initial values of
parameters :

map<string,unknown> values <- user_input(["Number" :: 100, "Location" :: {10, 10}]); create bug number: int(values at "Number") with: [location:: (point(values at "Location"))]; map<string,unknown> values2 <- user_input("Enter numer of agents and locations",["Number" :: 100, "Location" :: {10, 10}]); create bug number: int(values2 at "Number") with: [location:: (point(values2 at "Location"))];

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-545}

changes the shortest path computation method of the given graph

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-111}

the right-hand operand can be ``Djikstra'', ``Bellmann'', ``Astar'' to
use the associated algorithm. Note that these methods are dynamic: the
path is computed when needed. In contrarily, if the operand is another
string, a static method will be used, i.e.~all the shortest are
previously computed.

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-550}

Marks the file as read-only or not, depending on the second boolean
argument, and returns the first argument

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-113}

A file is created using its native flags. This operator can change them.
Beware that this change is system-wide (and not only restrained to
GAMA): changing a file to read-only mode (e.g. ``writable(f, false)'')

\subsubsection{Examples:}\label{examples-390}

\begin{verbatim}
 
file var0 <- shape_file("../images/point_eau.shp") writable false; // var0 equals returns a file in read-only mode

  ---\textgreater{} \texttt{bool}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Result:}\label{result-552}

a bool value, equal to the logical xor between the left-hand operand and
the right-hand operand. False when they are equal

\subsubsection{Comment:}\label{comment-114}

both operands are always casted to bool before applying the operator.
Thus, an expression like 1 xor 0 is accepted and returns true.

\section{General syntax}\label{general-syntax}

A statement represents either a declaration or an imperative command. It
consists in a keyword, followed by specific facets, some of them
mandatory (in bold), some of them optional. One of the facet names can
be omitted (the one denoted as omissible). It has to be the first one.

\begin{verbatim}
statement_keyword expression1 facet2: expression2 ... ;
or
statement_keyword facet1: expression1 facet2: expression2 ...;
\end{verbatim}

If the statement encloses other statements, it is called a
\textbf{sequence statement}, and its sub-statements (either sequence
statements or single statements) are declared between curly brackets, as
in:

\begin{verbatim}
statement_keyword1 expression1 facet2: expression2... { // a sequence statement
     statement_keyword2 expression1 facet2: expression2...;  // a single statement
     statement_keyword3 expression1 facet2: expression2...;
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{=}\label{section-18}

\subsubsection{Facets}\label{facets}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{right} (float), (omissible) : the right part of the equation
  (it is mandatory that it can be evaluated as a float
\item
  \texttt{left} (any type): the left part of the equation (it should be
  a variable or a call to the diff() or diff2() operators)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition}

Allows to implement an equation in the form function(n, t) = expression.
The left function is only here as a placeholder for enabling a simpler
syntax and grabbing the variable as its left member.

\subsubsection{Usages}\label{usages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The syntax of the = statement is a bit different from the other
  statements. It has to be used as follows (in an equation):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
float t; float S; float I; equation SI {     diff(S,t) = (- 0.3 * S * I / 100);    diff(I,t) = (0.3 * S * I / 100); }
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  See also: \protect\hyperlink{equation}{equation},
  \protect\hyperlink{solve}{solve},
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Embedments}\label{embedments}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{=} statement is of type: \textbf{Single statement}
\item
  The \texttt{=} statement can be embedded into: equation,
\item
  The \texttt{=} statement embeds statements:
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\subsection{action}\label{action-1}

\subsubsection{Facets}\label{facets-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{name}} (an identifier), (omissible) : identifier of
  the action
\item
  \texttt{index} (a datatype identifier): if the action returns a map,
  the type of its keys
\item
  \texttt{of} (a datatype identifier): if the action returns a
  container, the type of its elements
\item
  \texttt{type} (a datatype identifier): the action returned type
\item
  \texttt{virtual} (boolean): whether the action is virtual (defined
  without a set of instructions) (false by default)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition-1}

Allows to define in a species, model or experiment a new action that can
be called elsewhere.

\subsubsection{Usages}\label{usages-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The simplest syntax to define an action that does not take any
  parameter and does not return anything is: ```
\end{itemize}

action simple\_action \{ // {[}set of statements{]} \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   If the action needs some parameters, they can be specified betwee, braquets
    after the identifier of the action:
\end{verbatim}

action action\_parameters(int i, string s)\{ // {[}set of statements
using i and s{]} \}

\begin{verbatim}


* If the action returns any value, the returned type should be used instead of the "action" keyword. A return statement inside the body of the action statement is mandatory.
  
\end{verbatim}

int action\_return\_val(int i, string s)\{ // {[}set of statements using
i and s{]} return i + i; \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   If virtual: is true, then the action is abstract, which means that the
    action is defined without body. A species containing at least one abstract
    action is abstract. Agents of this species cannot be created. The common use
    of an abstract action is to define an action that can be used by all its
    sub-species, which should redefine all abstract actions and implements its
    body.
\end{verbatim}

species parent\_species \{ int virtual\_action(int i, string s); \}
species children parent: parent\_species \{ int virtual\_action(int i,
string s) \{ return i + i; \} \}

\begin{verbatim}

    
* See also: [do](#do), 

#### Embedments
* The `action` statement is of type: **Sequence of statements or action**
* The `action` statement can be embedded into: Species, Experiment, Model, 
* The `action` statement embeds statements: [assert](#assert),  [return](#return),  

----

[//]: # (keyword|statement_add)
### add 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`to`** (any type in [container, species, agent, geometry]): an expression that evaluates to a container
  * `item` (any type), (omissible) : any expression to add in the container
  * `all` (any type): Allows to either pass a container so as to add all its element, or 'true', if the item to add is already a container.
  * `at` (any type): position in the container of added element
  * `edge` (any type): a pair that will be added to a graph as an edge (if nodes do not exist, they are also added)
  * `node` (any type): an expression that will be added to a graph as a node.
  * `vertex` (any type): 
  * `weight` (float): An optional float value representing the weight to attach to this element in case the container is a graph 
    
#### Definition

Allows to add, i.e. to insert, a new element in a container (a list, matrix, map, ...).Incorrect use: The addition of a new element at a position out of the bounds of the container will produce a warning and let the container unmodified. If all: is specified, it has no effect if its argument is not a container, or if its argument is 'true' and the item to add is not a container. In that latter case

#### Usages

* The new element can be added either at the end of the container or at a particular position.
\end{verbatim}

add expr to: expr\_container; // Add at the end add expr at: expr to:
expr\_container; // Add at position expr

\begin{verbatim}

-   Case of a list, the expression in the facet at: should be an integer.
\end{verbatim}

list workingList \textless{}- {[}{]}; add 0 at: 0 to: workingList
;//workingList equals {[}0{]}add 10 at: 0 to: workingList ;//workingList

* Case of a map: As a map is basically a list of pairs key::value, we can also use the add statement on it. It is important to note that the behavior of the statement is slightly different, in particular in the use of the at facet, which denotes the key of the pair.
\end{verbatim}

map\textless{}string,string\textgreater{} workingMap \textless{}-
{[}{]}; add ``val1'' at: ``x'' to: workingMap;//workingMap equals
{[}``x''::``val1''

\begin{verbatim}

-   If the at facet is omitted, a pair expr_item::expr_item will be added to the
    map. An important exception is the case where the expr_item is a pair: in
    this case the pair is added.
\end{verbatim}

add ``val2'' to: workingMap;//workingMap equals {[}``x''::``val1'',
``val2''::``val2''{]}add ``5''::``val4'' to: workingMap; //workingMap

* Notice that, as the key should be unique, the addition of an item at an existing position (i.e. existing key) will only modify the value associated with the given key.
\end{verbatim}

add ``val3'' at: ``x'' to: workingMap;//workingMap equals
{[}``x''::``val3'', ``val2''::``val2'', ``5''::``val4''

### agents

#### Facets

-   `value` (container): the set of agents to display

-   `name` (a label), (omissible) : Human readable title of the layer

-   `aspect` (an identifier): the name of the aspect that should be used to
    display the species

-   `fading` (boolean): Used in conjunction with 'trace:', allows to apply a
    fading effect to the previous traces. Default is false

-   `focus` (agent): the agent on which the camera will be focused (it is
    dynamically computed)

-   `position` (point): position of the upper-left corner of the layer. Note
    that if coordinates are in [0,1[, the position is relative to the size of
    the environment (e.g. {0.5,0.5} refers to the middle of the display) whereas
    it is absolute when coordinates are greater than 1 for x and y. The
    z-ordinate can only be defined between 0 and 1. The position can only be a
    3D point {0.5, 0.5, 0.5}, the last coordinate specifying the elevation of
    the layer.

-   `refresh` (boolean): (openGL only) specify whether the display of the
    species is refreshed. (true by default, useful in case of agents that do not
    move)

-   `selectable` (boolean): Indicates whether the agents present on this layer
    are selectable by the user. Default is true

-   `size` (point): extent of the layer in the screen from its position.
    Coordinates in [0,1[ are treated as percentages of the total surface, while
    coordinates \> 1 are treated as absolute sizes in model units (i.e.
    considering the model occupies the entire view). Like in 'position', an
    elevation can be provided with the z coordinate, allowing to scale the layer
    in the 3 directions

-   `trace` (any type in [boolean, int]): Allows to aggregate the visualization
    of agents at each timestep on the display. Default is false. If set to an
    int value, only the last n-th steps will be visualized. If set to true, no
    limit of timesteps is applied.

-   `transparency` (float): the transparency rate of the agents (between 0 and
    1, 1 means no transparency)

#### Definition

`agents` allows the modeler to display only the agents that fulfill a given
condition.

#### Usages

-   The general syntax is:
\end{verbatim}

display my\_display \{ agents layer\_name value: expression
{[}additional options{]}; \}

\begin{verbatim}


* For instance, in a segregation model, `agents` will only display unhappy agents:
\end{verbatim}

display Segregation \{ agents agentDisappear value: people as list where
(each.is\_happy = false) aspect: with\_group\_color; \}

-   `maximize` (float): the value the algorithm tries to maximize

-   `minimize` (float): the value the algorithm tries to minimize

-   `nb_iter_cst_temp` (int): number of iterations per level of temperature

-   `temp_decrease` (float): temperature decrease coefficient

-   `temp_end` (float): final temperature

-   `temp_init` (float): initial temperature

#### Definition

the wikipedia article and [batch161 the batch dedicated page].

#### Usages

-   As other batch methods, the basic syntax of the annealing statement uses
    `method annealing` instead of the expected `annealing name: id` :
\end{verbatim}

method annealing {[}facet: value{]};

\begin{verbatim}

### ask

#### Facets

-   `target` (any type in [container, agent]), (omissible) : an expression that
    evaluates to an agent or a list of agents

-   `as` (species): an expression that evaluates to a species

-   `parallel` (any type in [boolean, int]): (experimental) setting this facet
    to 'true' will allow 'ask' to use concurrency when traversing the targets;
    setting it to an integer will set the threshold under which they will be run
    sequentially (the default is initially 20, but can be fixed in the
    preferences). This facet is false by default.

#### Definition

Allows an agent, the sender agent (that can be the [Sections161\#global world
agent]), to ask another (or other) agent(s) to perform a set of statements. If
the value of the target facet is nil or empty, the statement is ignored.

#### Usages

-   Ask a set of receiver agents, stored in a container, to perform a block of
    statements. The block is evaluated in the context of the agents' species
\end{verbatim}

ask \$\{receiver\_agents\} \{ \$\{cursor\} \}

\begin{verbatim}


* Ask  one agent to perform a block of statements. The block is evaluated in the context of the agent's species
\end{verbatim}

ask \$\{one\_agent\} \{ \$\{cursor\} \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   If the species of the receiver agent(s) cannot be determined, it is possible
    to force it using the `as` facet. An error is thrown if an agent is not a
    direct or undirect instance of this species
\end{verbatim}

ask\$\{receiver\_agent(s)\} as: \$\{a\_species\_expression\} \{
\$\{cursor\} \}

\begin{verbatim}


* To ask a set of agents to do something only if they belong to a given species, the `of_species` operator can be used. If none of the agents belong to the species, nothing happens
\end{verbatim}

ask \$\{receiver\_agents\} of\_species \$\{species\_name\} \{
\$\{cursor\} \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   Any statement can be declared in the block statements. All the statements
    will be evaluated in the context of the receiver agent(s), as if they were
    defined in their species, which means that an expression like `self` will
    represent the receiver agent and not the sender. If the sender needs to
    refer to itself, some of its own attributes (or temporary variables) within
    the block statements, it has to use the keyword `myself`.
\end{verbatim}

species animal \{ float energy \textless{}- rnd (1000) min: 0.0 \{
reflex when: energy \textgreater{} 500 \{ // executed when the energy is
above the given threshold list others \textless{}- (animal at\_distance
5); // find all the neighboring animals in a radius of 5 meters float
shared\_energy \textless{}- (energy - 500) / length (others); // compute
the amount of energy to share with each of them ask others \{ // no need
to cast, since others has already been filtered to only include animals
if (energy \textless{} 500) \{ // refers to the energy of each animal in
others energy \textless{}- energy + myself.shared\_energy; // increases
the energy of each animal myself.energy \textless{}- myself.energy -
myself.shared\_energy; // decreases the energy of the sender \} \} \} \}

    instead of an error

#### Definition

Allows to check if the evaluation of a given expression returns true. If not, an
error (or a warning) is raised. If the statement is used inside a test, the
error is not propagagated but invalidates the test (in case of a warning, it
partially invalidates it). Otherwise, it is normally propagated

#### Usages

-   Any boolean expression can be used
\end{verbatim}

assert (2+2) = 4; assert self != nil; int t \textless{}- 0; assert
is\_error(3/t); (1 / 2) is float

\begin{verbatim}


* if the 'warn:' facet is set to true, the statement emits a warning (instead of an error) in case the expression is false

    attributes 'TYPE_OCC' and 'NATURE' of the shapefile. One agent will be
    created by object contained in the shapefile:
\end{verbatim}

create a\_species from: the\_shapefile with: {[}type::
read(`TYPE\_OCC'), nature::read(`NATURE'){]};

\begin{verbatim}


* In order to create agents from a .csv file, facet `header` can be used to specified whether we can use columns header:
\end{verbatim}

create toto from: ``toto.csv'' header: true
with:{[}att1::read(``NAME''), att2::read(``TYPE''){]}; or create toto
from: ``toto.csv'' with:{[}att1::read(0), att2::read(1){]}; //with
read(int), the index of the column

\begin{verbatim}

-   Similarly to the creation from shapefile, modelers can create agents from a
    set of geometries. In this case, one agent per geometry will be created
    (with the geometry as shape)
\end{verbatim}

create species\_of(self) from: {[}square(4),circle(4){]}; // 2 agents
have been created, with shapes respectively square(4) and circle(4)

\begin{verbatim}


* Created agents are initialized following the rules of their species. If one wants to refer to them after the statement is executed, the returns keyword has to be defined: the agents created will then be referred to by the temporary variable it declares. For instance, the following statement creates 0 to 4 agents of the same species as the sender, and puts them in the temporary variable children for later use.
\end{verbatim}

create species (self) number: rnd (4) returns: children; ask children \{
// \ldots{} \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   If one wants to specify a special initialization sequence for the agents
    created, create provides the same possibilities as ask. This extended syntax
    is:
\end{verbatim}

create a\_species number: an\_int \{
\protect\hyperlink{statements}{statements} \}

\begin{verbatim}


* The same rules as in ask apply. The only difference is that, for the agents created, the assignments of variables will bypass the initialization defined in species. For instance:
\end{verbatim}

create species(self) number: rnd (4) returns: children \{ set location
\textless{}- myself.location + \{rnd (2), rnd (2)\}; // tells the
children to be initially located close to me set parent \textless{}-
myself; // tells the children that their parent is me (provided the
variable parent is declared in this species) \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   Desprecated uses:
\end{verbatim}

// Simple syntax create species: a\_species number: an\_int;

\begin{verbatim}


* If `number` equals 0 or species is not a species, the statement is ignored.

If false, the value will be diffused in the masked cells, but masked cells won't diffuse the value afterward (lost of signal). (default value : false)
  * `cycle_length` (int): the number of diffusion operation applied in one simulation step
  * `mask` (matrix): a matrix masking the diffusion (matrix created from a image for example). The cells corresponding to the values smaller than "-1" in the mask matrix will not diffuse, and the other will diffuse.
  * `mat_diffu` (matrix): the diffusion matrix (can have any size)
  * `matrix` (matrix): the diffusion matrix ("kernel" or "filter" in image processing). Can have any size, as long as dimensions are odd values.
  * `method` (an identifier), takes values in: {convolution, dot_product}: the diffusion method
  * `min_value` (float): if a value is smaller than this value, it will not be diffused. By default, this value is equal to 0.0. This value cannot be smaller than 0.
  * `propagation` (a label), takes values in: {diffusion, gradient}: represents both the way the signal is propagated and the way to treat multiple propagation of the same signal occurring at once from different places. If propagation equals 'diffusion', the intensity of a signal is shared between its neighbors with respect to 'proportion', 'variation' and the number of neighbors of the environment places (4, 6 or 8). I.e., for a given signal S propagated from place P, the value transmitted to its N neighbors is : S' = (S / N / proportion) - variation. The intensity of S is then diminished by S `*` proportion on P. In a diffusion, the different signals of the same name see their intensities added to each other on each place. If propagation equals 'gradient', the original intensity is not modified, and each neighbors receives the intensity : S / proportion - variation. If multiple propagation occur at once, only the maximum intensity is kept on each place. If 'propagation' is not defined, it is assumed that it is equal to 'diffusion'.
  * `proportion` (float): a diffusion rate
  * `radius` (int): a diffusion radius (in number of cells from the center)
  * `variation` (float): an absolute value to decrease at each neighbors 
    
#### Definition

This statements allows a value to diffuse among a species on agents (generally on a grid) depending on a given diffusion matrix.

#### Usages

* A basic example of diffusion of the variable phero defined in the species cells, given a diffusion matrix math_diff is:
\end{verbatim}

matrix math\_diff \textless{}-
matrix({[}{[}1/9,1/9,1/9{]},{[}1/9,1/9,1/9{]},{[}1/9,1/9,1/9{]}{]});
diffuse var: phero on: cells mat\_diffu: math\_diff;

\begin{verbatim}

-   The diffusion can be masked by obstacles, created from a bitmap image:
\end{verbatim}

diffuse var: phero on: cells mat\_diffu: math\_diff mask: mymask;

\begin{verbatim}


* A convenient way to have an uniform diffusion in a given radius is (which is equivalent to the above diffusion):
\end{verbatim}

diffuse var: phero on: cells proportion: 1/9 radius: 1;

\end{verbatim}

display my\_display \{ species agent1 aspect: base; species agent2
aspect: base; species agent3 aspect: base; \}

-   Each species layer can be placed at a different z value using the opengl
    display. position:{0,0,0} means the layer will be placed on the ground and
    position:{0,0,1} means it will be placed at an height equal to the maximum
    size of the environment.

### do 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`action`** (an identifier), (omissible) : the name of an action or a primitive
  * `internal_function` (any type): 
  * `returns` (a new identifier): create a new variable and assign to it the result of the action
  * `with` (map): a map expression containing the parameters of the action 
    
#### Definition

Allows the agent to execute an action or a primitive.  For a list of primitives available in every species, see this [BuiltIn161 page]; for the list of primitives defined by the different skills, see this [Skills161 page]. Finally, see this [Species161 page] to know how to declare custom actions.

#### Usages

* The simple syntax (when the action does not expect any argument and the result is not to be kept) is:
\end{verbatim}

do name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive;

\begin{verbatim}

-   In case the action expects one or more arguments to be passed, they are
    defined by using facets (enclosed tags or a map are now deprecated):
\end{verbatim}

do name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive arg1: expression1 arg2: expression2;

\begin{verbatim}


* In case the result of the action needs to be made available to the agent, the action can be called with the agent calling the action (`self` when the agent itself calls the action) instead of `do`; the result should be assigned to a temporary variable:
\end{verbatim}

type\_returned\_by\_action result \textless{}- self
name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive {[}{]};

\begin{verbatim}

-   In case of an action expecting arguments and returning a value, the
    following syntax is used:
\end{verbatim}

type\_returned\_by\_action result \textless{}- self
name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive {[}arg1::expression1,
arg2::expression2{]};

\begin{verbatim}


* Deprecated uses: following uses of the `do` statement (still accepted) are now deprecated:
\end{verbatim}

// Simple syntax: do action: name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive; // In case
the result of the action needs to be made available to the agent, the
\texttt{returns} keyword can be defined; the result will then be
referred to by the temporary variable declared in this attribute: do
name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive returns: result; do
name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive arg1: expression1 arg2: expression2
returns: result; type\_returned\_by\_action result \textless{}-
name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive(self, {[}arg1::expression1,

made available to the agent let result \textless{}-
name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive(self, {[}{]}); // In case the action
expects one or more arguments to be passed, they can also be defined by
using enclosed \texttt{arg} statements, or the \texttt{with} facet with
a map of parameters: do name\_of\_action\_or\_primitive with:

-   `material` (25): Set a particular material to the object (only if you are in
    the "use_shader" mode).

    For instance, 'species a schedules: (10 among a)' will result in a
    population that schedules only 10 of its own agents every cycle. 'species b
    schedules: []' will prevent the agents of 'b' to be scheduled. Note that the
    scope of agents covered here can be larger than the population, which allows
    to build complex scheduling controls; for instance, defining 'global
    schedules: [] {...} species b schedules: []; species c schedules: b + world;

search an optimal solution by applying evolution operators on an initial
population of solutions. There are three types of evolution operators:
crossover, mutation and selection. Different techniques can be applied for this
selection. Most of them are based on the solution quality (fitness).

#### Usages

-   As other batch methods, the basic syntax of the `genetic` statement uses
    `method genetic` instead of the expected `genetic name: id` :

    that if coordinates are in [0,1[, the position is relative to the size of
    the environment (e.g. {0.5,0.5} refers to the middle of the display) whereas
    it is absolute when coordinates are greater than 1 for x and y. The
    z-ordinate can only be defined between 0 and 1. The position can only be a
    3D point {0.5, 0.5, 0.5}, the last coordinate specifying the elevation of
    the layer.

    species is refreshed. (true by default, usefull in case of agents that do
    not move)

-   `size` (point): extent of the layer in the screen from its position.
    Coordinates in [0,1[ are treated as percentages of the total surface, while
    coordinates \> 1 are treated as absolute sizes in model units (i.e.
    considering the model occupies the entire view). Like in 'position', an
    elevation can be provided with the z coordinate, allowing to scale the layer
    in the 3 directions

-   `trace` (any type in [boolean, int]): Allows to aggregate the visualization
    at each timestep on the display. Default is false. If set to an int value,
    only the last n-th steps will be visualized. If set to true, no limit of
    timesteps is applied.

-   `transparency` (float): the transparency rate of the agents (between 0 and
    1, 1 means no transparency)

The z-ordinate can only be defined between 0 and 1. The position can only be a 3D point {0.5, 0.5, 0.5}, the last coordinate specifying the elevation of the layer.
  * `refresh` (boolean): (openGL only) specify whether the image display is refreshed or not. (false by default, true should be used in cases of images that are modified over the simulation)
  * `size` (point): extent of the layer in the screen from its position. Coordinates in [0,1[ are treated as percentages of the total surface, while coordinates > 1 are treated as absolute sizes in model units (i.e. considering the model occupies the entire view).

  * `name` (a new identifier), (omissible) : a temporary variable name
  * `from` (int): an int expression
  * `over` (any type in [container, point]): a list, point, matrix or map expression
  * `step` (int): an int expression
  * `times` (int): an int expression
  * `to` (int): an int expression
  * `while` (boolean): a boolean expression 
    
#### Definition

Allows the agent to perform the same set of statements either a fixed number of times, or while a condition is true, or by progressing in a collection of elements or along an interval of integers. Be aware that there are no prevention of infinite loops. As a consequence, open loops should be used with caution, as one agent may block the execution of the whole model.

#### Usages

* The basic syntax for repeating a fixed number of times a set of statements is:
\end{verbatim}

loop times: an\_int\_expression \{ //
\protect\hyperlink{statements}{statements} \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements while a condition holds
    is:
\end{verbatim}

loop while: a\_bool\_expression \{ //
\protect\hyperlink{statements}{statements} \}

\begin{verbatim}


* The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements by progressing over a container of a point is:
\end{verbatim}

loop a\_temp\_var over: a\_collection\_expression \{ //
\protect\hyperlink{statements}{statements} \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements while an index iterates
    over a range of values with a fixed step of 1 is:
\end{verbatim}

loop a\_temp\_var from: int\_expression\_1 to: int\_expression\_2 \{ //
\protect\hyperlink{statements}{statements} \}

\begin{verbatim}


* The incrementation step of the index can also be chosen:
\end{verbatim}

loop a\_temp\_var from: int\_expression\_1 to: int\_expression\_2 step:
int\_expression3 \{ // \protect\hyperlink{statements}{statements} \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   In these latter three cases, the name facet designates the name of a
    temporary variable, whose scope is the loop, and that takes, in turn, the
    value of each of the element of the list (or each value in the interval).
    For example, in the first instance of the "loop over" syntax :
\end{verbatim}

int a \textless{}- 0; loop i over: {[}10, 20, 30{]} \{ a \textless{}- a
+ i; \} // a now equals 60

\begin{verbatim}


* The second (quite common) case of the loop syntax allows one to use an interval of integers. The from and to facets take an integer expression as arguments, with the first (resp. the last) specifying the beginning (resp. end) of the inclusive interval (i.e. [to, from]). If the step is not defined, it is assumed to be equal to 1 or -1, depending on the direction of the range. If it is defined, its sign will be respected, so that a positive step will never allow the loop to enter a loop from i to j where i is greater than j
\end{verbatim}

list the\_list \textless{}-list (species\_of (self)); loop i from: 0 to:
length (the\_list) - 1 \{ ask the\_list at i \{ // \ldots{} \} \} //
every agent of the list is asked to do something

value in the switch. If they match, the embedded statement set is executed.
Three kinds of match can be used

#### Usages

-   match block is executed if the switch value is equals to the value of the
    match:
\end{verbatim}

switch 3 \{ match 1 \{write ``Match 1''; \} match 3 \{write ``Match 2'';
\} \}

\begin{verbatim}


* match_between block is executed if the switch value is in the interval given in value of the match_between:
\end{verbatim}

switch 3 \{ match\_between {[}1,2{]} \{write ``Match OK between
{[}1,2{]}''; \} match\_between {[}2,5{]} \{write ``Match OK between
{[}2,5{]}''; \} \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   match_one block is executed if the switch value is equals to one of the
    values of the match_one:
\end{verbatim}

  * `tabu_list_size_min` (int): minimal size of the tabu list 
    
#### Definition

This algorithm is a simple implementation of the Reactive Tabu Search algorithm ((Battiti et al., 1993)). This Reactive Tabu Search is an enhance version of the Tabu search. It adds two new elements to the classic Tabu Search. The first one concerns the size of the tabu list: in the Reactive Tabu Search, this one is not constant anymore but it dynamically evolves according to the context. Thus, when the exploration process visits too often the same solutions, the tabu list is extended in order to favor the diversification of the search process. On the other hand, when the process has not visited an already known solution for a high number of iterations, the tabu list is shortened in order to favor the intensification of the search process. The second new element concerns the adding of cycle detection capacities. Thus, when a cycle is detected, the process applies random movements in order to break the cycle. See [batch161 the batch dedicated page].

#### Usages

* As other batch methods, the basic syntax of the reactive_tabu statement uses `method reactive_tabu` instead of the expected `reactive_tabu name: id` : 
\end{verbatim}

method reactive\_tabu {[}facet: value{]};

\begin{verbatim}

-   For example:
\end{verbatim}

method reactive\_tabu iter\_max: 50 tabu\_list\_size\_init: 5
tabu\_list\_size\_min: 2 tabu\_list\_size\_max: 10
nb\_tests\_wthout\_col\_max: 20 cycle\_size\_min: 2 cycle\_size\_max: 20
maximize: food\_gathered;

#### Facets 

  * `name` (an identifier), (omissible) : the identifier of the reflex
  * `when` (boolean): an expression that evaluates a boolean, the condition to fulfill in order to execute the statements embedded in the reflex. 
    
#### Definition

Reflexes are sequences of statements that can be executed by the agent. Reflexes prefixed by the 'reflex' keyword are executed continuously. Reflexes prefixed by 'init' are executed only immediately after the agent has been created. Reflexes prefixed by 'abort' just before the agent is killed. If a facet when: is defined, a reflex is executed only if the boolean expression evaluates to true.

#### Usages

* Example:
\end{verbatim}

reflex my\_reflex when: flip (0.5)\{ //Only executed when flip returns
true write ``Executing the unconditional reflex''; \}

### release

#### Facets

-   `target` (any type in [agent, list, 27]), (omissible) : an expression that
    is evaluated as an agent/a list of the agents to be released or an agent
    saved as a map

-   `as` (species): an expression that is evaluated as a species in which the
    micro-agent will be released

-   `in` (agent): an expression that is evaluated as an agent that will be the
    macro-agent in which micro-agent will be released, i.e. their new host

-   `returns` (a new identifier): a new variable containing a list of the newly
    released agent(s)

#### Definition

Allows an agent to release its micro-agent(s). The preliminary for an agent to
release its micro-agents is that species of these micro-agents are sub-species
of other species (cf. [Species161\#Nesting_species Nesting species]). The
released agents won't be micro-agents of the calling agent anymore. Being
released from a macro-agent, the micro-agents will change their species and host
(macro-agent).

#### Usages

-   We consider the following species. Agents of "C" species can be released
    from a "B" agent to become agents of "A" species. Agents of "D" species
    cannot be released from the "A" agent because species "D" has no parent
    species.
\end{verbatim}

species A \{ \ldots{} \} species B \{ \ldots{} species C parent: A \{
\ldots{} \} species D \{ \ldots{} \} \ldots{} \}

\begin{verbatim}


* To release all "C" agents from a "B" agent, agent "C" has to execute the following statement. The "C" agent will change to "A" agent. The won't consider "B" agent as their macro-agent (host) anymore. Their host (macro-agent) will the be the host (macro-agent) of the "B" agent.
\end{verbatim}

release list(C);

\begin{verbatim}

-   The modeler can specify the new host and the new species of the released
    agents:
\end{verbatim}

release list (C) as: new\_species in: new host;

  * `item` (any type), (omissible) : any expression to remove from the container
  * `all` (any type): an expression that evaluates to a container. If it is true and if the value a list, it removes the first instance of each element of the list. If it is true and the value is not a container, it will remove all instances of this value.
  * `edge` (any type): Indicates that the item to remove should be considered as an edge of the receiving graph
  * `index` (any type): any expression, the key at which to remove the element from the container
  * `key` (any type): any expression, the key at which to remove the element from the container
  * `node` (any type): Indicates that the item to remove should be considered as a node of the receiving graph
  * `vertex` (any type):  
    
#### Definition

Allows the agent to remove an element from a container (a list, matrix, map...).

#### Usages

* This statement should be used in the following ways, depending on the kind of container used and the expected action on it:
\end{verbatim}

remove expr from: expr\_container; remove index: expr from:
expr\_container; remove key: expr from: expr\_container; remove all:
expr from: expr\_container;

\begin{verbatim}

-   In the case of list, the facet `item:` is used to remove the first occurence
    of a given expression, whereas `all` is used to remove all the occurrences
    of the given expression.
\end{verbatim}

list removeList \textless{}- {[}3,2,1,2,3{]}; remove 2 from:
removeList;//removeList equals {[}3,1,2,3{]}remove 3 all: true from:
removeList;//removeList equals {[}1,2{]}remove index: 1 from:
removeList;//removeList equals {[}1{]}

\begin{verbatim}


* In the case of map, the facet `key:` is used to remove the pair identified by the given key.
\end{verbatim}

map\textless{}string,int\textgreater{} removeMap \textless{}-
{[}``x''::5, ``y''::7, ``z''::7{]}; remove key: ``x'' from:
removeMap;//removeMap equals {[}``y''::7, ``z''::7{]}remove 7 all: true
from: removeMap;//removeMap equals map({[}{]})

\begin{verbatim}

-   In addition, a map a be managed as a list with pair key as index. Given
    that, facets item:, all: and index: can be used in the same way:
\end{verbatim}

map removeMapList \textless{}- {[}``x''::5, ``y''::7, ``z''::7,
``t''::5{]}; remove 7 from: removeMapList;//removeMapList equals
{[}``x''::5, ``z''::7, ``t''::5{]}remove {[}5,7{]} all: true from:
removeMapList;//removeMapList equals {[}``t''::5{]}remove index: ``t''
from: removeMapList;//removeMapList equals map({[}{]}

\begin{verbatim}


* In the case of a graph, both edges and nodes can be removes using node: and edge facets. If a node is removed, all edges to and from this node are also removed.
\end{verbatim}

graph removeGraph \textless{}-
as\_edge\_graph({[}\{1,2\}::\{3,4\},\{3,4\}::\{5,6\}{]}); remove node:
\{1,2\} from: removeGraph; remove node(1,2) from: removeGraph;\\
list var \textless{}- removeGraph.vertices; // var equals
{[}\{3,4\},\{5,6\}{]} list var \textless{}- removeGraph.edges; // var
equals {[}polyline(\{3,4\}::\{5,6\}){]}remove edge: \{3,4\}::\{5,6\}
from: removeGraph; remove edge(\{3,4\},\{5,6\}) from: removeGraph;\\
list var \textless{}- removeGraph.vertices; // var equals
{[}\{3,4\},\{5,6\}{]} list var \textless{}- removeGraph.edges; // var
equals {[}

\begin{verbatim}

-   In the case of an agent or a shape, `remove` allows to remove an attribute
    from the attributes map of the receiver. However, for agents, it will only
    remove attributes that have been added dynamically, not the ones defined in
    the species or in its built-in parent.
\end{verbatim}

global \{ init \{ create speciesRemove; speciesRemove sR \textless{}-
speciesRemove(0); // sR.a now equals 100 remove key:``a'' from: sR; //
sR.a now equals nil \} \} species speciesRemove \{ int a \textless{}-
100; \}

#### Usages

* Example:
\end{verbatim}

string foo \{ return ``foo''; \} reflex \{ string foo\_result
\textless{}- foo(); // foos\_result is now equals to ``foo'' \}

\begin{verbatim}

-   In the specific case one wants an agent to ask another agent to execute a
    statement with a return, it can be done similarly to:
\end{verbatim}

// In Species A: string foo\_different \{ return ``foo\_not\_same''; \}
/// \ldots{}. // In Species B: reflex writing \{ string temp
\textless{}- some\_agent\_A.foo\_different {[}{]}; // temp is now equals

-   `cell_height` (float): (grid only), the height of the cells of the grid

-   `cell_width` (float): (grid only), the width of the cells of the grid

-   `compile` (boolean):

-   `control` (22): defines the architecture of the species (e.g. fsm...)

-   `edge_species` (species): In the case of a species defining a graph topology
    for its instances (nodes of the graph), specifies the species to use for
    representing the edges

-   `file` (file): (grid only), a bitmap file that will be loaded at runtime so
    that the value of each pixel can be assigned to the attribute 'grid_value'

-   `files` (list): (grid only), a list of bitmap file that will be loaded at
    runtime so that the value of each pixel of each file can be assigned to the
    attribute 'bands'

-   `frequency` (int): The execution frequency of the species (default value:
    1). For instance, if frequency is set to 10, the population of agents will
    be executed only every 10 cycles.

-   `height` (int): (grid only), the height of the grid (in terms of agent
    number)

-   `horizontal_orientation` (boolean): (hexagonal grid only),(true by default).
    Allows use a hexagonal grid with a horizontal or vertical orientation.

-   `mirrors` (any type in [list, species]): The species this species is
    mirroring. The population of this current species will be dependent of that
    of the species mirrored (i.e. agents creation and death are entirely taken
    in charge by GAMA with respect to the demographics of the species mirrored).
    In addition, this species is provided with an attribute called 'target',
    which allows each agent to know which agent of the mirrored species it is
    representing.

-   `neighbors` (int): (grid only), the chosen neighborhood (4, 6 or 8)

-   `neighbours` (int): (grid only), the chosen neighborhood (4, 6 or 8)

    algorithm for the shortest path computation ("BF", "Dijkstra", "A*" or
    "JPS\*"

-   `parallel` (any type in [boolean, int]): (experimental) setting this facet
    to 'true' will allow this species to use concurrency when scheduling its
    agents; setting it to an integer will set the threshold under which they
    will be run sequentially (the default is initially 20, but can be fixed in
    the preferences). This facet has a default set in the preferences (Under
    Performances \> Concurrency)

-   `parent` (species): the parent class (inheritance)

-   `schedules` (container): A container of agents (a species, a dynamic list,
    or a combination of species and containers) , which represents which agents
    will be actually scheduled when the population is scheduled for execution.
    For instance, 'species a schedules: (10 among a)' will result in a
    population that schedules only 10 of its own agents every cycle. 'species b
    schedules: []' will prevent the agents of 'b' to be scheduled. Note that the
    scope of agents covered here can be larger than the population, which allows
    to build complex scheduling controls; for instance, defining 'global
    schedules: [] {...} species b schedules: []; species c schedules: b + world;
    ' allows to simulate a model where the agents of b are scheduled first,
    followed by the world, without even having to create an instance of c.

    instances of this species. Each new skill provides attributes and actions
    that will be added to the ones defined in this species

-   `topology` (topology): The topology of the population of agents defined by
    this species. In case of nested species, it can for example be the shape of
    the macro-agent. In case of grid or graph species, the topology is

-   `torus` (boolean): is the topology toric (defaut: false). Needs to be
    defined on the global species.

-   `use_individual_shapes` (boolean): (grid only),(true by default). Allows to
    specify whether or not the agents of the grid will have distinct geometries.
    If set to false, they will all have simpler proxy geometries

-   `use_neighbors_cache` (boolean): (grid only),(true by default). Allows to
    turn on or off the use of the neighbors cache used for grids. Note that if a
    diffusion of variable occurs, GAMA will emit a warning and automatically
    switch to a caching version

-   `use_regular_agents` (boolean): (grid only),(true by default). Allows to
    specify if the agents of the grid are regular agents (like those of any
    other species) or minimal ones (which can't have sub-populations, can't
    inherit from a regular species, etc.)

-   `virtual` (boolean): whether the species is virtual (cannot be instantiated,
    but only used as a parent) (false by default)

-   `width` (int): (grid only), the width of the grid (in terms of agent number)

#### Definition

The species statement allows modelers to define new species in the model.
`global` and `grid` are speciel cases of species: `global` being the definition
of the global agent (which has automatically one instance, world) and `grid`
being a species with a grid topology.

#### Usages
