It is possible to use in the models a set of built-in agents. These agents allow to directly use some advance features like clustering, multi-criteria analysis, etc. The creation of these agents are similar as for other kinds of agents:

```
create species: my_built_in_agent returns: the_agent;
```
    
So, for instance, to be able to use clustering techniques in the model:

```
create cluster_builder returns: clusterer;
```
