It is possible to use in the models a set of built-in agents. These agents allow to directly use some advance features like clustering, multi-criteria analysis, etc. The creation of these agents are similar as for other kinds of agents:

```
create species: my_built_in_agent returns: the_agent;
```
    
So, for instance, to be able to use clustering techniques in the model:

```
create cluster_builder returns: clusterer;
```

### Actions
	  
	 
#### **`halt`**
Allows to stop the current simulation so that cannot be continued after. All the behaviors and updates are stopped.
* returns: `unknown`
  
	 
#### **`pause`**
Allows to pause the current simulation **ACTUALLY EXPERIMENT FOR THE MOMENT**. It can be set to continue with the manual intervention of the user.
* returns: `unknown`
