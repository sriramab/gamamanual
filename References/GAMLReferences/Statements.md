## General syntax

A statement represents either a declaration or an imperative command. It consists in a keyword, followed by specific facets, some of them mandatory (in bold), some of them optional. One of the facet names can be omitted (the one denoted as omissible). It has to be the first one.

```
statement_keyword expression1 facet2: expression2 ... ;
or
statement_keyword facet1: expression1 facet2: expression2 ...;
```

If the statement encloses other statements, it is called a **sequence statement**, and its sub-statements (either sequence statements or single statements) are declared between curly brackets, as in:

```
statement_keyword1 expression1 facet2: expression2... { // a sequence statement
     statement_keyword2 expression1 facet2: expression2...;  // a single statement
     statement_keyword3 expression1 facet2: expression2...;
}
```
