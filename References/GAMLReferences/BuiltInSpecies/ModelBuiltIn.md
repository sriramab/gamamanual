# The 'model' built-in species (Under Construction)



As described in the [presentation of GAML](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Content\Tutorials\LearnGAMLStepByStep\Introduction.md), any model in GAMA is a species (introduced by the keyword [`global`](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Content\Tutorials\LearnGAMLStepByStep\ManipulateBasicSpecies\GlobalSpecies.md)) which directly inherits from an abstract species called `model`. This abstract species (sub-species of [`agent`](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Content\References\GAMLReferences\BuiltInSpecies\AgentBuiltIn.md)) defines several attributes and actions that can then be used in any global section of any model.



## `model` attributes
`model` defines several attributes, which, in addition to the attributes inherited from [`agent`](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Content\References\GAMLReferences\BuiltInSpecies\AgentBuiltIn.md), form the minimal set of knowledge a model can manipulate.
