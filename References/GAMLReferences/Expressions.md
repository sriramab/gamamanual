# Expressions



Expressions in GAML are the value part of the [statements](Statements.md)' facets. They represent or compute data that will be used as the value of the facet when the statement will be executed.

An expression can be either a [literal](Literals.md), a [unit](UnitsAndConstants.md), a [constant](UnitsAndConstants.md), a [variable](PseudoVariables.md), an [attribute](VariablesAndAttributes.md) or the application of one or several [operators](Operators.md) to compose a complex expression.
