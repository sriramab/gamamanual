# Gaml Reference



The following pages introduce the various constructs that are made available to the modelers in GAML. All these constructs are **built-in**, i.e. defined in Java, either in the core of GAMA or in its extensions. They include [species](G__BuiltInSpecies), [skills](G__BuiltInSkills), [control architectures](G__BuiltInControlArchitectures), [statements](G__Statements), [data types](G__DataTypes), and various types of [expressions](G__Expressions), including a long and quite exhaustive list of [operators](G__OperatorsAK).

This set of pages is to be used as a _reference_, which means its role is not to explain _how_ to properly use these constructs but to detail their structures and components.

It is, in that respect, to be used as a support for following the explanations provided in the sections dedicated to the [organization of a model](G__OrganizationModel), [the definition of species](G__DefiningSpecies), the definition of [GUI](G__DefiningExperiments) or [batch](G__BatchExperiments) experiments, and the various recipes or  how-to's provided [here](G__Recipes). It also serves as a precious guide for the various constructs introduced in the [tutorials](G__Tutorials).
